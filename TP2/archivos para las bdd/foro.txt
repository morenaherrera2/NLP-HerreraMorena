yes it has 2 goodie box but im surprise this game has no big expansion.

Never given that any thoughts so my view is really an « off the cuff » one, but I wonder how that could be achieved.
Seeing there is only 1 way to win, that being crossing the points markers, any « big » expansion couldn’t really introduce new mechanics.
Any new boards would detract from the main one and probably create too many worker spaces and make the game too open.
I believe the mini expansions are exactly the right way to spice up the game. Haven’t tried them all, and some are less interesting, but some do change things a lot.
Race games aren’t my preferred ones, but this one is my top 2 players game. The appeal of this game for me is that it’s a no fuss race game that plays quick, without too many rules overhead, and no game feels quite the same and can turn out drastically different depending on a lot of factors.

It's not a race game.

is a race game. This is a worker placement game.

I probably shouldn’t have phrased it the way I did, and I don’t want to insult any purist out there.
This being said, it may not technically be a race game, and even though the mechanic is worker placement, the « race » to get an engine going is definitely a big element.
To be honest, the race feeling is what transpires the most out of the game for me.
There are some games where you « race » to get an engine going, but may lack what’s needed to fuel it for the endgame.
In Rajas, once you’re engine is on, you really rarely come to a stall, and if your opponent isn’t matching you in his engine building, he will have a hard time winning
Granted, I’ve rarely played at 4 and it might be different, but as I said, this was a « off the cuff » comment.

It's not a race game.

It can be both, and it is.

It does however have 2 siblings ;

Rajas Cards & Karma

Dancer – Give up one die showing a “2.“ In return, you take any 2 dice from the supply and draw a face-down white yield tile. You immediately earn the yield of the tile (1 die, 3 money, 1 upgrade, or 1 karma). Then the yield tile is put aside to form a discard pile. When you run out of tiles, reshuffle the used ones and form a new supply.
Do you need to select your dice before you reveal the yield?  Or can you reveal the yield and then decide what dice to select?

Yes, you must select and give up your die with a '2' BEFORE reaping the benefit of the Dancer.

Yes, you must select and give up your die with a '2' BEFORE reaping the benefit of the Dancer.

As with any action that requires spending dice.

Yes, you must select and give up your die with a '2' BEFORE reaping the benefit of the Dancer.

That isn't the question. They're asking if you can see the yield before choosing which dice they take from the supply.

Yes, you must select and give up your die with a '2' BEFORE reaping the benefit of the Dancer.

That isn't the question. They're asking if you can see the yield before choosing which dice they take from the supply.

We always look at the yield first and afaik nothing in the rules does state otherwise.

As the OP mentioned, once you have paid the dancer cost then you take a face-down white yield tile. The operative word here being FACE-DOWN.  So no, you cannot look at the white tile prior to paying the die cost and committing to the action.

Ah, understood. Yes, the items of the yield can be in the order you prefer. Choose the token first or the dice first, your option.

I am new to Rajas and excited to learn more about the strategy in this game!
I decided to upgrade the Kali statues by designing a 3D printed dice holder with small pockets. If you have a 3D printer, I recommend checking out my design!
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6657611
The holder doesn't have spots for the 2 center dice on the basic side, but I found that the dice stay put just fine without support there.



Happy gaming and printing!

Nicely done, thanks for your effort!

Description
:
Dans Rajas of the Ganges, on se retrouve dans l’Inde à l’époque de l’empire moghol. Cette puissance en plein essor étend son territoire et gagne en prospérité grâce au commerce de la soie, du thé et des épices.
Des monuments imposants tels que le Taj Mahal ou le Fort Rouge sont érigés. De somptueux jardins sont créés, ainsi que de nouveaux édifices et parcs, qui émerveilleront les générations futures au cours des siècles à venir.
Alors que l’empire a pratiquement atteint son étendue maximale et se trouve dans une période de relative stabilité, les joueurs vont incarner des rajas ou des ranis et s’efforcer de se montrer à la hauteur de leur rang de vénérables souverains.
Pour cela, ils devront transformer leurs terres en provinces opulentes et prestigieuses. En prenant garde de veiller à leur karma, les joueurs devront se développer de façon équilibrée, en conciliant au mieux prestige et prospérité. Celui ou celle qui connaîtra la plus grande réussite accèdera au statut envié de souverain légendaire de la nation.
Des dés, mais peu de hasard !
Bien que le jeu repose principalement sur les dés et qu’on en lance tout au long de la partie, il reste qu’on peut toujours trouver une autre manière d’arrivé à ses fins quand on a pas les jets souhaités.
Un 1 n’est pas toujours une mauvaise chose vue que chaque chiffre apporte son pouvoir spécial et que l’on peut utiliser son karma pour prendre la valeur du dé de l’autre face. Le 1 passant ainsi à 6 peut faire bien du changement dans votre stratégie !
N’oublions pas la joie d’échanger un jet de dé qui nous sert à rien contre 2 autres dés de couleurs différentes ce qui peut nous ouvrir une myriades de possibilités…
L’importance de bien choisir sa voie
Rapidement on se rend compte qu’avec toutes les options possibles, on ne peut pas être partout et trop se diviser c’est s’assurer de perdre car on sera faible dans toutes les sphères.
Les voies possibles
Commençons par le cœur du royaume, les merveilles du monde, on en a 4, chacune à son importance quand on décide de bâtir son royaume en achetant des tuiles. Il faudra donc prévoir d’avance ce que l’on veut acheter comme tuile pour qu’elle nous fasse gagner le plus de points possible.
Ensuite il y a les 3 précieuses ressources, il faudra ici encore décider le plus rapidement possible sur quoi l’on veut baser sa stratégie: la diversité ou la spécialisation dans une ressource qui pourra nous rapporter gros ?
Le long fleuve n’est pas dénué d’intérêt non plus, il nous apportera tout au long de la partie des bonus non négligeables, il faut juste faire attention de bien compter ses déplacements qui nous font avance de la valeur du dés sur les espaces VIDES, détail qui a toute son importance !
En dernier recours il y aura toujours la possibilité d’utiliser un ouvrier pour récupérer un dé d’une couleur. Certes c’est très peu, mais parfois on aura besoin de tout utiliser pour faire de grandes choses; il faut juste savoir comment rebondir rapidement à défaut de perdre un tour entier pour se refaire…
Intérêt
:
C’est un bon placement d’ouvrier avec une belle course au point qui va dans les deux sens. Le premier joueur qui réussit à faire croiser son niveau de prestige avec sa richesse met fin à la partie et bien souvent il risque de la remporter sauf si la course est bien serré.
On a bien aimé Rajas of the Ganges pour cet aspect, c’est bien fait et cela fait changement des autres placements d’ouvriers qui ont souvent tendances à nous faire jouer un nombre x de tours avant la fin de la partie.
Ici on ne sait pas quand la partie va réellement terminer et cela ajoute donc un certain stress et importance de faire ses actions au tour présent pour ne pas se faire avoir en prévoyant trop d’avance.
Le niveau de difficulté n’est pas très élevé et on peu facilement croire qu’après une partie on saura comment mieux s’y prendre et donc rejouer pour s’améliorer sera un plaisir.
La belle variété des actions font de Rajas of the Ganges un choix que je conseil plus qu’un jeu comme Little Town et Stone Age qui sont tout les deux de bons jeux, mais avec un niveau de redondance beaucoup plus grand.

Es gibt nicht immer nur Kuchen und Kekse. Kennen Sie diesen Ausdruck, liebe Brettspielfans? Ich wurde daran erinnert, als ich gestern Abend am Ende eines Brettspielabends die Teile von Rajas of the Ganges zurück in die Schachtel legte. Bis eine Stunde zuvor war es eines meiner Lieblingsspiele gewesen.
Wenn ich anderen das Spiel erkläre, erzähle ich ihnen immer, dass Rajas of the Ganges im Indien des 16. Jahrhunderts spielt, in der Zeit, in der sich das mächtige Reich der Großmogule entwickelt, genauer gesagt in der Gegend zwischen den Flüssen Indus und Ganges. Die Spieler schlüpfen in diesem Spiel in die Rolle von Rajas oder Ranis - einflussreichen Adligen des Landes - und konkurrieren miteinander, indem sie sowohl geistigen als auch materiellen Reichtum anhäufen und gleichzeitig versuchen, ihre Ländereien zu reichen und prächtigen Provinzen auszubauen.
Während des Spiels verwenden die Spieler sowohl Würfel als auch Geld, um ihre Aktionen auszuführen. Manchmal das eine, manchmal das andere, manchmal beides und immer unterstützt durch den Einsatz eines ihrer Arbeiter. Sie müssen diese Aktionen sorgfältig planen, da sie ihre Arbeiter nicht immer an den gewünschten Stellen platzieren können. Interessant ist auch der Einsatz von Karma in diesem Spiel, das unmögliche Aktionen plötzlich wieder möglich macht.
Ich habe mich damals wegen der Grafik in dieses Spiel verguckt wie in einen Klotz. Als ich diese schöne Schachtel mit all den fröhlichen Farben sah, wollte ich das Spiel haben. Ich hatte noch nichts angefasst, noch keinen Schritt getan.
Zu Hause angekommen, sabberte ich über den Karton, und mein Bauchgefühl ließ mich sofort zugreifen. Was sich herausstellte: Das Spiel wurde von Markus und Inka Brandt entwickelt (die auch für jede Menge Escape Games und den Welthit Village verantwortlich sind). Das gab Zuversicht.
Noch wichtiger war aber, dass es bei der Grafik Klick gemacht hat. Das stammt nämlich von Dennis Lohausen. Wir kennen ihn wiederum von den tollen Spielen von Uwe Rosenberg, aber auch von First Rat. Er ist der große Favorit in der Mevrouw Verschuur Arena. Lohausen ist ein Mann, der mehrere Illustrationsstile beherrscht. Völlig geblendet von dem überwältigenden Anblick, hatte ich es gar nicht bemerkt.
Aber. Es war also völlig verständlich, dass ich darauf hereinfiel, und ich brauchte mich nicht zu schämen.
Obwohl es wunderschön anzusehen ist, wenn alles vor einem auf dem Tisch liegt, werde ich nicht behaupten, dass es immer eine Freude ist, Rajas of the Ganges zu spielen. Zunächst einmal bringen die Würfel einen nicht zu unterschätzenden Glücksfaktor ins Spiel. Ich habe das anfangs hartnäckig heruntergespielt, bis ich kürzlich eine Partie gespielt habe, in der ich fast ständig Einsen und Zweien geworfen habe. Dann habe ich tatsächlich verschiedene Sachen rausgekriegt. Außerdem sind die verfügbaren oder nicht verfügbaren Landschaftsplättchen auch so eine Sache. Wenn da zufällig nichts Passendes dabei ist, hat man Pech gehabt.
Das alles ist jedoch nichts im Vergleich zu der "Taktik", die erfahrene Mehrspieler-Spieler anwenden, wenn das Spiel etwa zur Hälfte durch ist. Diese Taktik besteht darin, dass man drei Märkte (Tee, Gewürze, Seide) auf seinem Landgut hat, die jeweils 3 Punkte wert sind, so dass man in jeder Runde einen Arbeiter auf den Markt schicken kann und jedes Mal 9 Gratispunkte erhält.
Diese Methode nimmt dem Spiel den ganzen Spaß. Vor allem, wenn mehrere Spieler sie anwenden, verkommt das Spiel zu einem ziemlich vulgären und freudlosen Wettlauf um Punkte.
Warum erzähle ich Ihnen das?
Nun, liebe Freunde des Brettspiels, zufällig habe ich Rajas gestern in einen Spieleclub mitgenommen (in Vorbereitung auf einen Termin, den ich Ende dieser Woche habe). Noch zufälliger ist, dass einer meiner Mitspieler uns vor Beginn des Spiels dreimal in umsichtiger Weise vor dieser äußerst lästigen und niedrigen Spielweise gewarnt hat.
Ich fand das sehr sympathisch von ihm und dachte sofort: "Oh, dieser Herr kennt diese fiese Methode und ist genauso angewidert davon wie ich". Dadurch fühlte ich mich sicher, der betreffende Herr wurde mir noch sympathischer und ich bekam noch mehr Lust zu spielen, als ich es ohnehin schon hatte.
Ich war jedoch zutiefst enttäuscht, als dieser Charakter (entschuldigen Sie den Ausdruck, aber mir fällt nichts anderes ein) diese Taktik nicht nur selbst anwandte, sondern auch seine Freundin dazu ermutigte, das Gleiche zu tun.
Im Ergebnis endete das Spiel in einem langweiligen und freudlosen Wettlauf zweier Spieler um die Punkte, der mich an die Traumata meiner dunkelsten Monopoly-Tage erinnerte.
Für das Spiel und die Illustration gebe ich Rajas 10 fette Sterne. Für den Glücksfaktor und die Punktejagd ziehe ich einen Stern ab.

When using the gem dealer from goodie box two you place it on the game track for workers on game space 15.
When you take it the rules say to replace one of your unused workers.
If playing with the Navaratnas version it seems you would replace a worker and then only have 5, not six to play with. Is that right?

It’s the goodie box and space 10, not goodie box 2 and space 15. Anyway, you keep the gem trader as one of your workers after you get it, so the number of workers available to you doesn’t change. The gem trader gives you an extra ability when you use it for a worker placement.

When you do a market action for Goods of One Kind, does it have to be the kind shown on the space you go to or can it be any one kind of good?

When you do a market action for Goods of One Kind, does it have to be the kind shown on the space you go to or can it be any one kind of good?

My reading of the rules and the example is that these spaces are for the specific product depicted and only that product.
On a logical standpoint, it would be way too easy to be allowed to use all three for whatever product you choose.

The iconography should make it clear enough. The three upper spaces are marked with one Tea, one Silk, one Rice respectively. Put your meeple on the Tea space and you score all of, and only, your Tea Markets, etc. The bottom two spaces allow you to score your single best markets from each of the three types.

Wife and I just purchased this second hand at a board game swap meet and we are missing 2 green province tiles.  Can anyone take a picture of all there green tiles so I can see what I'm missing and maybe figure out how to rig up 2 missing tiles?

There are enough images posted to this game's page that you may be able to deduce the missing two from there. When you find out which tiles are missing, contact someone here.
https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/220877/rajas-ganges

Looks like there is a pretty comprehensive pic in the image gallery showing all of the tiles ...
https://boardgamegeek.com/image/6587301/rajas-ganges

Ya saw that I can't make out the numbers on the green titles.

Ya saw that I can't make out the numbers on the green titles.

It looks pretty clear to me on my laptop.
From left to right there are two 4s, two 5s, two 6s, two 7s, two 8s, four 9s and 2 10s

Just looked at my copy, there are the following green tiles
Tiger 10,9,9,8,7
Snake 6,6,5,5,4,4
Bull 10,10,9,8,7
I'll try to upload a photo in a bit.

Awesome thanks

You can't have it all I thought when I placed the pieces of Rajas of the Ganges back in the box at the end of a board game night last night. It was one of my favorite games until an hour before.
When I explain the game to others I always tell them that Rajas of The Ganges is set in 16th century India during the period when the mighty empire of the Great Moguls was developing and more specifically in the area between the rivers Indus and Ganges. The players in this game take on the role of Rajas or Ranis - influential nobles of the country - and compete with each other in amassing both spiritual and tangible wealth while simultaneously trying to develop their estates into wealthy and magnificent provinces.
During the game, players use both dice and money to perform their actions. Sometimes one, sometimes the other, sometimes both and always supported by the placement of one of their workers. They will have to plan these actions carefully because they cannot always place their workers in the places they want. Also interesting is the use of karma in this game, which makes impossible actions suddenly possible again.
I fell in love with this game because of the artwork. When I saw that beautiful box, with all those cheerful colors, I wanted to have the game. I hadn't touched anything yet, hadn't made a move yet. I just had to own this.
And when I'd bought it and having it in front of me, at home, drooling over the cardboard, my gut feeling immediately clicked.
As it turned out, the game was designed by Markus and Inka Brandt (who are also responsible for many escape games plus the world hit Village). That gave confidence.
Even more important was my click with the artwork. That turned out to be from Dennis Lohausen. We know them from the big games by Uwe Rosenberg, but also from First Rat. Big favorites in the Mrs. Verschuur Arena. Lohausen is a man who has mastered several illustration styles. Completely blinded by the overwhelming sight, I hadn't even noticed.
But... it was completely understandable that I fell for it and so I had nothing to be ashamed of.
Although beautiful to see when it is all laid out in front of you, I will no longer claim that it is always a joy to play Rajas of the Ganges.
First of all, the dice provide a luck factor in the game that should not be underestimated. I initially persistently downplayed this until I recently played a game in which I threw ones and twos almost constantly. Then I had a different story. In addition, the available or unavailable landscape tiles are also a thing. If there isn't anything that suits you, then you're out of luck.
However, all this pales in comparison to the "tactics" that seasoned heavy players use when the game is about halfway through. This tactic means that you have three markets (tea, spices, silk) on your estate, each with a value of 3. This allows you to send a worker to the market on each turn, scoring 9 free points each time.
This method takes all the joy out of the game. Especially when there are more players who use this, the game degenerates into a rather vulgar and joyless point-buying race.
Why am I telling this?
Well, dear board game enthusiasts, it just so happens that I took Rajas to a Games Club yesterday (in preparation for an appointment I have later this week). It was even more coincidental that one of my fellow players warned us three times before the start of the game about this extremely annoying and base way of playing.
I thought that was very sympathetic of him and immediately thought: "Oh, this gentleman is aware of that annoying method and is just as disgusted by it as I am."
This made me feel safe, made the gentleman in question even more sympathetic and made me want to play even more than I initially had.
However, my deep disappointment was when this figure (sorry for the expression, but I can't make anything else of it) not only applied this tactic himself, but also encouraged his girlfriend to do the same.
The game therefore ended in a boring and joyless run for the points by two players, which reminded me of the traumas of my darkest Monopoly days.
For the game and the artwork I give Rajas 10 big stars. I'll deduct a star for the luck factor and the points race.

This is a  top 10 game for me and I don't think there is an overriding strategy or that luck plays an enormous role in who wins.

The game values 1 fame (or whatever it is....the yellow stuff) at 2 money. With fully upgraded temples (4 fame each) a 2 temple tile can net you 8 fame....equivalent to 16 money. Also if you notice a player is consistently taking a 9 money market action you could use your many rolled 1s to take the first player action and then block that market space (only one player can take the action so I assume the figure and his girlfriend were doing it on alternate turns). In a recent game one player won by accelerating up the river to take an early 4th worker and secure a strong lead. I think the game gives you many ways to victory and every so called dominant strategy is counterable or has something equally as powerful.

I wonder if a simple house rule could help this a bit. I thought about trying that if you take the free market action you have to get rid of a die of your choice. Seems like it could balance it some.

Het is niet altijd koek en ei wat de klok slaat. Kent u die uitdrukking, allerbeste liefhebbers van het bordspel? ik moest daar aan denken toen ik gisteravond aan het eind van een bordspelavond de onderdelen van Rajas of the Ganges terug in de doos deed. Het was tot een uur daarvoor een van mijn favoriete spellen.
Wanneer ik het spel aan anderen uitleg vertel ik altijd dat Rajas of The Ganges speelt in het 16e-eeuwse India in de periode dat het machtige rijk van de Grote Moguls zich ontwikkelt en dan meer specifiek in het gebied tussen de rivieren de Indus en de Ganges. De spelers in dit spel nemen de rol aan van Rajas of Ranis - invloedrijke edelen van het land - en wedijveren met elkaar in het vergaren van zowel spirituele als tastbare rijkdom terwijl ze tegelijkertijd hun landgoederen proberen te ontwikkelen tot rijke en magnifieke provincies.
Tijdens het spel gebruiken de spelers zowel dobbelstenen als geld om hun acties uit te voeren. Soms het een, soms het ander, soms beiden en altijd ondersteund door het plaatsen van een van hun werkers. Die acties zullen ze zorgvuldig moeten plannen omdat ze niet altijd hun werkers kunnen plaatsen op de plekken die ze willen. Interessant is ook het gebruik van karma in dit spel waarmee onmogelijke acties toch ineens weer wel mogelijk zijn.
Ik ben destijds als een blok voor dit spel gevallen vanwege het artwork. Toen ik die prachtige doos zag, met al die vrolijke kleuren, toen wilde ik het spel hebben. Ik had nog niets aangeraakt, nog geen zet gedaan.
Eenmaal thuis, kwijlend boven het karton, vielen meteen de kwartjes op zijn plek in mijn buikgevoel. Wat bleek: het spel is bedacht door Markus en Inka Brandt (die ook verantwoordelijk zijn voor heul veul escape spellen plus de wereldhit Village). Dat gaf vertrouwen.
Belangrijker was nog mijn click met het artwork . Dat bleek van Dennis Lohausen. Die kennen we weer van de grote spellen van Uwe Rosenberg maar ook van First Rat. Grote favorieten in de Mevrouw Verschuur Arena. Lohausen is een kerel die meerdere illustratiestijlen beheerst. Totaal verblind door de overweldigende aanblik had ik daar niet eens op gelet.
Maar... het was dus volkomen verklaarbaar dat ik er voor viel en ik hoefde me dus nergens voor te schamen.
Hoewel prachtig om te zien wanneer het allemaal voor je op tafel ligt zal ik niet meer beweren dat het altijd een vreugde is om Rajas of the Ganges te spelen. Allereerst zorgen de dobbelstenen voor een niet te onderschatten geluksfactor in het spel. Ik heb dat aanvankelijk hardnekkig gebagatelliseerd totdat ik laatst een partijtje speelde waarin ik vrijwel constant enen en tweeën gooide. Toen piepte ik wel andere koek. Daarnaast zijn de al-dan-niet beschikbare landschapstegels ook een dingetje. Wanneer er toevallig niets tussen ligt dat jou past dan heb je pech.
Dat alles valt echter in het niet bij de "taktiek" die doorgewinterde veelspelers gebruiken wanneer het spel ongeveer over de helft gevorderd is. Die taktiek houdt in dat je een drietal markten (thee, specerijen, zijde) op je landgoed hebt met elk waarde 3. Hierdoor kun je in elke beurt een werker naar de markt sturen waardoor je telkens 9 gratis punten scoort.
Deze methode haalt alle vreugde uit het spel. Zeker wanneer er meer spelers zijn die dit toepassen degenereert dit het spel tot een tamelijk ordinaire en vreugdeloze puntenkooprace.
Waarom vertel ik dit?
Welnu, allerbeste liefhebbers van het bordspel, het toeval wil dat ik Rajas gisteren had meegenomen naar een Spellenclub (als voorbereiding op een afspraak die ik later deze week heb). Nóg toevalliger was het dat een van mijn medespelers voor aanvang van het spel ons tot drie maal toe omstandig waarschuwde voor die buitengewoon vervelende en lage manier van spelen.
Ik vond dat zeer sympathiek van hem en dacht meteen: "Oh, deze meneer is van die vervelende methode op de hoogte en walgt daar al net zo van als ik". Hierdoor kreeg ik een veilig gevoel, werd de meneer in kweste nóg sympathieker en had ik nóg meer zin om te spelen dan ik aanvankelijk al had.
Groot was echter mijn diepe teleurstelling toen deze figuur (sorry voor de uitdrukking maar ik kan er niets anders van maken) niet alleen zelf deze taktiek toepaste maar bovendien ook nog zijn vriendin aanspoorde hetzelfde te doen.
Het spel eindigde daardoor in een saaie en vreugdeloze run naar de punten door twee spelers, wat me deed denken aan de trauma's uit mijn donkerste monopolydagen.
Voor het spel en het artwork geef ik Rajas 10 vette sterren. Voor de geluksfactor en de puntenrace trek ik een ster af.

I know when you overbuild you don't score the bonus again. Keyword being again. What if your original build didn't connect a bonus and you rebuild over it connecting the bonus you didn't get on the original build? Do you score that bonus since you didn't score it initially or do you just never get the bonus for overbuild?
We played it as not getting the bonus but I wanted to clarify for future reference

That is an interesting one. I don't know the actual rule but I would think you could take it since you haven't yet and now you can! Following to see if anyone confirms. You didn't have a path before, now you do, so take! That seems to make sense.

I don’t know if there ever was an official reply, but it’s discussed in this thread:
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1913405/master-builder-scor...
Although the last person to reply believed the English wording was the right one, other posters mentioned that the German and French version of the rules made it clear you can’t claim a yield bonus when you overbuild, even if not previously connected.
I can confirm that my French version says that a player doesn’t receive a yield bonus when overbuilding, which is how I personally have been playing.

I was one of the people in the cited thread who pointed out the German was clear that you never get the bonus when overbuilding. The German version is worded as straightforwardly as you could want; it even has the "never" in bold.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let me start by saying I really dislike dice games. And I would not own this game or like it if it were not for this very simple variant:
All dice are rolled when they go into the pool and not when they are taken out.
When you take a die out of the pool you Do Not roll it. You choose a die of the appropriate color knowing what number it is.
At the start of the game roll one die of each color per player and the players draft them.
The player with the lowest total goes first.
For an easy game keep all dice available pre rolled in the dice pool.
For a more challenging game fill the aviailable dice pool at the start of each turn to only 4 dice of each color.
This will result in the dice pool dominated by 1s & 2s for all players equally.
If you love the game as is, this variant is not for you, and that is great.
If you like the idea of this variant and you try it out. I would love to hear your suggestions for improvements.

If this works for you, this is great.
I am genuinely curious how AP inducing this might become? I mean, the “as per rules” method certainly has a luck factor and once you’ve settled on the dice you want and rolled them, you “simply” need to find the most optimal way to use them.
Having 4 full pool of already rolled dice, I’m thinking you’d be paralyzed by all the options.
Again, not trying to be negative about your variant; I’m simply curious

Since dice are basically currency, you are giving yourself the ability to choose whichever value suits you, whereas the original rules force you to make strategic decisions based on what you have. You're just making decisions easier. That's a "meh" rating from me for this variant. The dice mechanics for this game, including the color requirements, are as good as they get.

I have found Analysis paralysis can be an issue in a lot of games depending on who you're playing with. There are games. I certainly would not play with certain people who are prone to that. I did not find it to be a major issue in this game.

I already said if you love the game as is this variant is not for you. And that is great for you.
This is not the thread you're looking for.

I love dice but thank you for sharing for anyone who may want a little less luck. I think the idea is neat, and could be fun to roll some of the dice before hand and then try to draft them as is. Then in euro-fashion you can plan a bit more when you need a number range but roll and lose. I mean the point of the game is to adapt but it still sounds fun. I am glad you found a way to enjoy a great game even if most of us liked the original! Thanks for sharing! Maybe I will try it sometime.
It could also be cool to not put dice back into the pool. If only two purple 6s popped up you better grab them early, but you would constantly see what your other options are or how many dice you'd need to take that purple six action (grab two 3s!).

Maybe so, but since I love this game, virtually all posts about variants will get my attention, so this WAS the thread I'm looking for. IMHO, your variant breaks the game, or at least alters it dramatically. Maybe this isn't the game you're looking for. No doubt you'll also hate

, and that's OK. I'll admit that when dice directly dictate actions or movement, it makes for an awful game, Monopoly being the most notorious example. But if a dice roll is simply a factor in YOUR decision making process, that's just another minor luck component, like drawing a face-down card or revealing a tile. Are you OK with stuff like that?

I love dice but thank you for sharing for anyone who may want a little less luck. I think the idea is neat, and could be fun to roll some of the dice before hand and then try to draft them as is. Then in euro-fashion you can plan a bit more when you need a number range but roll and lose. I mean the point of the game is to adapt but it still sounds fun. I am glad you found a way to enjoy a great game even if most of us liked the original! Thanks for sharing! Maybe I will try it sometime.
It could also be cool to not put dice back into the pool. If only two purple 6s popped up you better grab them early, but you would constantly see what your other options are or how many dice you'd need to take that purple six action (grab two 3s!).

Thank you! I really like that idea! Start with all dice available but add no dice to the pool until a color runs out. I will try that next time I get this to the table. (Which would be never if we were restricted from using house rules)

I like the idea in general and I would be happy to try it, but what I wonder is / why would the pool be dominated by 1s and 2s? And why does the lowest total dice player go first? These seem to assume lower numbers are bad compared to higher numbers. But I see the numbers as quite balanced. If anything, I think 3s and 4s are the worst, because karma can make 1s and 2s high very quick. The spot for the 2 die possibly being the most coveted spot on the board.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rajas is a dice rolling and worker placement game, where you pay with dice and sometimes money for an action. It looks like a lot because the board is super busy, but it really isn't so bad
The base game has already been reviewed by many, so I will quickly tell you about the expansions:
Tiger, cow and snake tiles: each of them add a new tile to the respective stacks with an immediate bonus and a continuous bonus. They cost 2 of the same colour dice or one specific colour and one extra one.
-The cow tiles give you extra money for the market actions (and money when you place them)
-With the snake tiles you can take a worker back from the board and replace it somewhere else (so another action), nothing else happens
-The tiger tiles are all different and grant you for example a bonus where you can trade one die for two other dice if you go to the Palace. Or one extra step when sailing with the boat
Mango Village are also new tiles that give you bonuses. They cost two of the same valued dice (can be different colours). When placed they give you a bonus, but when activated they give you the bonus again. You can activate up to two of them by going to the specific mango Market, which is a new location on the board
The karma track now has a new board as well, where you can place your worker and take a bonus of an unoccupied karma space. Front side: 1 fame, 3 coins, 1 upgrade or 1 die (back side: 1 fame per current karma level, 1 boat step, sell 2 goods or a white bonus token)
Next to the karma track is a new track, where you can place a worker to gain coins for the 3 tiles next to your Palace. The backside does the same, but now you also have to roll a die and depending on the number you rolled and the tiles on your player board, you get coins.
There are new river tiles and two ways to play them (see the rulebook for this). We played with them face down and however arrives first gets a coin for exploring
And the pink elephant, but unfortunately we didn't use it. Whoever is on the reroll spot can take the pink elephant and reuse a spot that the starting player has occupied. It can also be stolen, but we wouldn't know..
Then there are the Tokens from the Holi festival, which are placed on the score tracks. However reaches these tiles first takes one die of each colour and rolls them. The last player gets to pick first, followed by the second to last etc. The last player also gets to use this tile as a one-time joker tile, where they can pretend a die is of a different colour
The trader is a new worker that replaces another worker. This worker is placed at fame 10. If you get the worker, you can make the die you use for that action, into any pip value you want! This one is super strong!
And the last one (I think), is the one with the starting tiles. You have forest, water, desert or mountain, each with their own bonus. You get one random one and have to place it in one of four specific locations on your board. It just makes you reach the sides earlier, but as you place it you also receive a bonus.
All in all a fun game and (most of) the expansions make it more fun!
So yes, to me they are worth it, although the base game already offers enough for me as it is. I will not add them to every play, but it is a good way to keep the game interesting.

fwiw there are most likely additional reviews (some maybe video) in the individual forums for those 2 expansions.....




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I thought I might pick this up. Is it only on the secondary market right now?
Is there a reprint coming?

We always keep it in stock,
https://rnrgames.com/rajas-of-the-ganges

It's not in stock in Europe unfortunately

Dutch version is available ?

Hi, if this is still relevant, there are 3 pieces in stock in "TLAMA Games" - a Czech webshop.
They deliver to Hungary, and I think to the rest of Europe too...
https://www.tlamagames.com/en/board-games/rajas-of-the-gange...
I've also seen the game on a greek "amazon-like" webshop called "Skroutz" - it's still in EU, so no tax and customs needed, like the Czech site.
I've ordered board games from both sites, with TLAMA I used Packeta, arrived within 2 days to a pick up box, and Skroutz uses DHL, 2-5 working days, they can also be redirected to a pick up box.

Hi all,
Today we're reviewing an older board game, but one we believe people will be playing for many years to come. Be sure to check out our Instagram, where you'll also find this review:

.

Rajas of the Ganges

: HUCH!
: Inka & Markus Brand
: Dennis Lohausen
: 2-4
: 12+
: 45-75’
: Dice Rolling, Network and Route Building, Race, Tile Placement & Worker Placement
You’re a raja in 16th century India who wants to develop his estate into a wealthy province. You’ll try to achieve this by sending out workers and accumulate dice to gather fame and wealth. During his turn a player sends out a worker to one of the locations on the board and, after paying the required money or dice, carries out the accompanying action. The game ends when a player’s markers on the fame and money tracks, which run in opposite directions, pass each other. The player with the biggest difference between both markers wins.
Compliments to the designers for the iconography used in Rajas of the Ganges. Though the game board is beautifully illustrated, it looks very crowded and overwhelming at first. After a few turns the iconography really comes true and makes everything seem logical. Besides worker and tile placement, which we love, Rajas of the Ganges uses dice as a resource to pay for certain actions. The value of your dice is determined by rolling said dice and can cause some real joy or frustration.
We like that everything in Rajas of the Ganges is connected. Sending your worker to a location causes additional actions, bonuses and opens up other possibilities. We also like that you earn extra workers, in addition to the 3 workers you start with, by passing certain spaces on the river, fame or money track. It can happen that some players have more workers than others at a certain point. The final thing we want to talk about is the end game trigger. The passing markers on both tracks took us some getting used to. It was the first time we’ve experienced this in a game and feels different. Prepare yourself for some low or even negative scores.
Rajas of the Ganges is a fantastic worker placement game that gives players a lot of options and possibilities. Using dice as a resource adds some randomness that may or may not work in your favor. After you’ve played the game a couple of times you’ll get used to the end game trigger and the low scores that come with it. Definitely a game that’ll stay in our collection and will see a lot more plays.

Hi all!
I just bought Rajas with goodie box 1 & 2 second hand online.
When counting through the components I noticed that there are only 6 white yield tiles and not 8.
Does anyone of you guys perhaps have images of the tiles so that I can make my own?
Thank you in advance for your time and help!
With warm regards,
Rza

There you go:


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rajas of the Ganges
is a strategy game with a combination of different mechanisms and a very unique end game trigger.



Gameplay Overview

In
Rajas of the Ganges
the players take the roles of nobles in 16th century India, trying to build influential estates that will give them fame and wealth beyond measure!
Each player starts the game with an empty province board, a few dice and 3 workers but all of those keep improving over time. During the game players take turns placing their workers and using their available dice in order to build their province and earn fame and wealth.
The fame and wealth of each player are marked on tracks around the board, one going clockwise and the other counterclockwise. When the 2 markers meet, the end game is triggered. Some players are then allowed to take an extra turn so that everyone has taken the same amount of turns in that round, and the game ends. Whoever has the biggest cross over of the fame and wealth trackers wins the game!
There are several ways to earn wealth and fame throughout the game. The main focus is building your province and earning rewards through that but it’s definitely not the only way. In order to do that, you’ll also need to keep getting more dice and eventually a few more workers.
All of that can be accomplished through the different actions you can take in your turns, like purchasing tiles and building them on your board, travelling the river to gain benefits, visiting the palace for various different results and going to the market place to sell your goods.
Always make sure to keep an eye on everyone’s wealth and fame trackers though, because the game starts slow but in the end everything happens pretty fast!



Components

Rajas of the Ganges
is a well-produced game.
Everything is of good quality, the board is double sided in order to accommodate for different numbers of players and the insert is exceptional.
The artwork is beautiful and very thematic. The board can feel a bit busy at first but honestly, that felt like it added to the theme. I don’t think anyone would characterize the Indian artwork as minimalistic and that’s why it feels right for this game board to be full of details and intricate designs! When you start paying close attention, it is also very informative and offers everything you need to know for each action and its costs and benefits.



Rules, Setup & Game Time

At first, the rules for
Rajas of the Ganges
felt like a lot of information and the symbols were overwhelming. It didn’t take long though to realize that at its core it’s a rather simple game and the symbols are very straight forward. As we mentioned already, you have everything you need to know marked on the board and there is no need to keep checking the rulebook after a while.
The setup is fast and the great insert helps a lot with that. The only part that takes a couple of minutes is shuffling the province tiles and stacking them appropriately but it really isn’t much at all.
The game time estimation on the box felt pretty accurate but it also depends on the mode you’ll choose to play. We noticed the game taking a bit longer with the added variants but nothing that would greatly surpass the suggested game duration. Naturally, it also depends on the players and how much time they need to decide on their action but that goes without saying.



Our Thoughts

While playing the base mode of the game, the one initially introduced in the rulebook, we felt like
Rajas of the Ganges
was missing something. Thankfully this feeling went away the moment we added the suggested variants! Playing the game in its simple form is probably a necessary step for a smooth teach, but we believe that it is essential to try the variants if you want the full experience of the game! After that, it quickly joined the list of our favorite games and we know we’ll be bringing it back to the table often!
Rajas of the Ganges
is one of those games that are easy to grasp but at the same time offers a lot of different options to the players. It has a good balance of different choices in each turn that are partially limited by the rolls and the colors of your dice. It is enough to help with analysis paralysis but not so much that it feels scripted and limiting.
We do realize that there are certain choices that are obviously better than others if you can get there first, but you still have to choose which one of those you’ll go for and which ones to leave for the other players to take, so that didn’t feel very limiting either. We saw some not so obvious choices shine as well, which is something we always enjoy in games. Keeping your mind and eyes open to different strategies is essential and also keeps the game fresh for long!
Rajas of the Ganges
is a game that includes a lot of dice rolling and apart from placing a worker, you’ll almost always be required to use some of your dice as well for the different actions. Inherently that means that there is some luck involved in the game but the rules are adjusted to specifically counter that to an extent. There are certain actions you can take with only specific rolls or specific dice colors and it’s not always the higher rolls that will give you access to the best choices. There is also the ability to spend Karma in order to flip one of your dice to its opposite side so you’re never really cornered if your rolls aren’t ideal. In extreme cases of good or bad luck though, it is possible that the outcome of the game will be affected. In the long run, we think that the dice add mainly variability and don’t often favor one player over the others.

Rajas of the Ganges
is a game that plays relatively fast, but at the same time is a well-designed, complete game that feels bigger than it is. There is enough time to build a strategy and make it work without it taking too long to complete. The fact that there is no downtime between turns and rounds helps a lot with that too. The only admin required is to gather your workers (3-6 workers depending on the game mode and the phase of the game) and pass the first player marker to the next player between rounds.
Lastly, the end trigger of
Rajas of the Ganges
is unique and very interesting! The fact that there are two tracks adds to the choices each player has for their strategy. It doesn’t matter if you focus mainly on wealth or fame or if you choose a good balance between both. You can win with any combination and that opens up a lot of possibilities. Each track provides some benefits as you progress so completely ignoring one may hurt you, but choosing your focus is always up to you! You also need to be on alert because if the game progresses enough things can start moving surprisingly fast and you may get caught unprepared for the end!
All in all, we think that
Rajas of the Ganges
is an excellent choice if you like worker placement, tile placement, dice rolling and a very unique end trigger! We know it’s going to stay in our collection and we would recommend you check it out if what you read sounded interesting!

Maybe I missed it scanning your review, but what are the variant rules? I played the base game at a convention, we didn't even look at the variants. I enjoyed the game as you did, but I would really like to know how the variants change the game. ,

I wondered if perhaps you meant variables, or variety?

Hello, thank you so much for reading!
There are a couple that you can choose to use.
First, you can use the back of the Kali statue which allows only 8 dice and allow all 6 workers to be picked up. You also use the back of the player board and there are special yield tiles that you can acquire during the game and add them to it. This provides a lot of extra choices and makes the board of each player unique.
Then there are extra little tiles that you can randomly place on the river so the river is never the same which makes each play different than the previous.
These are very short descriptions of course, you can find the rulebook in the files here on BGG if you'd like to check in more detail!

Rajas of the Ganges Rulebook

Ctrl+F for "Navaratnas Version" and "The Ganga Module".
In much the same vein as the OP is describing the variants included in the base game, the Goodie Box expansions each contain several mini-expansions you can mix and match to your heart's content, so they are also worth purchasing. You wouldn't ever play with all of them at the same time(there are thirteen of them in total), but it's been my experience that some of them should always be included because they do a good job of balancing the various ways to score points so there are more realistic, equal paths to victory.
Then you'll add in one or two of the other ones on top of that, play a couple of games with them, and then pick another one or two of them when you've figured out the best path to victory for that particular combination of mini-expansions. It stops players from auto-piloting through the game after having played it a dozen times; each time you have to think about how the mini-expansions interact with each other and influence the ways to score points.
There will be certain combinations(especially if you add more than two) which will completely ruin the game balance and make it practically impossible to use certain paths to victory, but you'll accidentally do this once and then it will be really obvious which ones you shouldn't add together.

Which of the modules from the goodies box are the ones that you think should always be included?

I'm not sure if the question is for us or

but we've written reviews for both Goodie Boxes if you'd like to check those out!

Goodie Box 1



Goodie Box 2

Either or both
Thanks for the links

Which of the modules from the goodies box are the ones that you think should always be included?

I would always add at least one expansion that offers extra opportunities to upgrade your building scoring, as well as at least one expansion that offers more opportunities to change a die value or colour(extra karma also helps with this). The market actions are a bit too strong in the base game because they are much less reliant on getting high die values and particular colours throughout the course of the game once you get your markets up and running, unlike fame scoring. Making the river a bit stronger is something I always choose to do, because then players need to keep more of an eye on it and actually try to compete there instead of just ignoring it. Adding at least one of the cow/tiger/snake expansions can also make players have to think twice about just taking the buildings or market actions they want when considering what tile to add to their province, which increases competition there. Adding in the expansions is mostly about trying to equally spread players' focus across all the areas of the board instead of them being able to just pay attention to one area.

Hi everyone. Which online implementation do people prefer? The Tabletopia or Yucata version? Any advice is much appreciated.

I don‘t think this is a good comparison. Yucata has full rule enforcement, but playing may feel less like playing on the table. I guess it depends on what you want

Yucata shows you your options and keeps your score and is like playing a video/computer game. It highlights what you are allowed to click etc.. I think Tabletopia is just like having to manipulate pieces on a table.. I am not a fan of that platform.

Tabletop Simulator has a great scripted implementation of the game. I just played it last night and it was excellent. Automatically refreshes the market and pulls your workers back to your board with the press of a button.

I heard a rumor said that there will be a 2nd print, maybe a big box version, which will include all stuffs in goodie box 1 & 2, in the near future. Does anyone know anything about it?

It has a listing on BGG, but not a lot of info about it's contents. It's fair to assume it will be base game + the content from the 2 goodie boxes, but nothing is confirmed as of now.

That is indicated 2022 but now is 2023. Is that one delayed or cancelled?

It was released last year and available from this web shop. It's an Italian-only release.
https://www.dragonstore.it/gestionali-rajas-of-the-ganges-bi...
The publisher has unboxing photos:
https://www.ravendistribution.it/unboxing-raja-of-the-ganges...
Feels like something the Italian publisher just whipped up quick, without Huch's involvement, as it's literally a big box containing the base game's plastic insert and the actual goodie boxes.
I wouldn't expect a Big Box product from Huch!, if it comes out at all, to look like this.

Hello
I purchased a copy of rajas of the ganges in Belgium and all my dices are losing all their white ink in the holes. If you yust hold the dices they flake on your fingers. I have never had such a problem in any game in my collection. And because of it i don't even want to play the game.
For months now i have been trying to contact HUSH! wich is the publisher of my version, but to no succes. I have tried filling in a form on their site and sending them an email on info@huchandfriends.de but after many months they are not responding.
I am not sure if i am using the right email/site or if they are yust bad at customer service.
If someone could help me that would be great.
Thanks in advance
Robin

see my reply at

Thanks for the reply, but that page was the first page i visited months ago. Tried contacting them via their site and when that failed i tried an email adres of them. They don't respond to anything.

see my reply at

Jeff, you may wish to move that content to this thread, as threads whose first posts have been deleted have a strong chance of being deleted themselves.
Oops, too late, sorry.
I know this is frustrating, Robin, and by all rights the publisher should have provided you with a working product but for the sake of your sanity, wouldn't it be easier to just order some dice online? I know the game seems to require quite a lot of them in different colors, and I don't know where you live, but dice are pretty cheap in many places, and your time is worth something too -- too much to keep sending emails into a publisher's customer service abyss.

Jeff's link was deleted so I don't know if it mentioned this. Have you tried info@hutter-trade.com?

Hey i have sent a mail to info@hutter-trade.com that emperor penguin suggested and if i don't get a response i will order some dice online. I don't have much hope as they don't seem like the most responsive publisher. But hopefully i am proven wrong. Thanks for the help guys.

We are the Dutch publisher of Raja's of the Ganges.
Although you have bought an Huch! International version, we would be willing to help out.
If you do not get any reply within 1 week, please inform, we will try and get you new dice through your FLGS

@HOT games. Thanks guys that is a really generous offer! If i don't get a reply i will contact you guys. I'm also okay with paying for shipping the dice.
(This is in dutch) heel erg bedankt voor de hulp, echt super vriendelijk!!

Hey
I didn't get any reply from the HUSH! publisher. If the offer still stands i would love to get other dice from HOT games.
Contact me if you can. I can also pay for shipping.
Thanks in advance. My email is robin_bousard@hotmail.com

Robin,
If you've not already done so, you might want to send the publisher a GM, in case they don't regularly monitor this thread. Super generous of them to offer their help in this manner.
Good luck!

Thanks for the suggestion Cattriona
I have sent them a GM, fingers crossed
.

Today when i looked in my mail i was suprised tot see that HUCH! Did sent me new dice. They didn't reply to anything but yust sent it after a really long time.
Thanks everyone.

I understand the placement of white yield tiles, but where are the other yield tiles placed?   (i guess once I know where the tiles are placed, I will know how to earn them)
thanks

They are used in the advanced rules only with the flipside of you player board.
They allow you to improve your connections bonuses over the course of the game.

Are you looking at the right side of the player board?
The other colors are not used in the « basic » game. Once you played a few times, you can play the  Navaratnas variant.
In that version you switch you player board and you will see the the bonus yield tile spots are different colors.
You start the game with a Brown tile picked at random.
During the game, when you go to the Dancer or you get a yield tile because you have less workers than your opponent, you get to choose which yield tile you want.
The Navaratnas variant is explained just before the modules explanations.

Can you use multiple karma to change multiple dice during your turn?

Hi PI Gamer--
Please go to the game's individual forums (each game in our database has its own forums) and ask your question there, so that others who have the same question can find the answer there when  they need it. Just search for Rajas of the Ganges in the big search box, click on the right title to go to the game's page and look for the word "Forums" underneath where you can rate the game in stars.
This forum is intended for help with BGG-related issues.
Good luck!

Can you use multiple karma to change multiple dice during your turn?

Yes. I believe you can spend all your karma if you wish.
It is better to ask these questions on the game’s page.  People who play / design / play tested specific games subscribe.  More likely to get an authoritative answer.  Asking on the general pages is far more random.

Can you use multiple karma to change multiple dice during your turn?

Yes, you can use as much karma as you have anytime during your turn.
You might consider updating the subject of  your post, now that it's been moved to the game's forum.

Hi
How long does a game with 2 players take on average?
Thanks

11 plays at 2P- averaging 50 min.

Thanks, last question:  how long is more or less the setup?

5 min or so. Sort the dice, put the different tiles in piles, and just a few small things. Even if you use the different variants, it doesn't add that much more to set up.

Just played our first two games at 2 player - setup is indeed in the 5 min range.
Both of our games ran around 90 mins to nearly 2 hours...not sure we forsee that coming down by half to 1 hour (or less) - maybe as we get more familiar with the tiles so some of our decision making would speed up a bit - but there are quite a few opportunities for clever plays so some think time will likely remain - we are not esp. AP prone

Hey everyone, I've been hard at work on my new solo mode for Rajas of the Ganges, and it supports all modules!
You will need to print and cut a very small deck of 13 cards to run this bot.
It uses a frontside/backside method where one card is flipped and placed next to another. One side shows the area it wants to go, and the other shows the decision being made.
Easy to manage and the bot mostly follows normal player rules, with minor exceptions.
I will be adding images to the rulebook eventually, but for now I can answer any questions you may have.
Enjoy and please comment with any feedback, questions and suggestions!

Hi Cell!
Tried out your automa yesterday and it worked great! There were one or two edge cases encountered that didn’t seem to be covered in the rules. The one I remember offhand is when using one of the River expansions there are tiles that grant 1-3 river movements. It wasn’t clear how many river spaces the automa would move if it landed on such a tile. We assumed 1 space, but would be open to a different ruling, assuming it’s not already in the rules and we missed it. Thanks!
Jim

Hey Jim! Thanks for trying it out and I'm glad it worked great for you!
I would either use the current choice card or draw a new one, just like every other decision.
Thanks for the catch, I'll add it to the rules.
How did the game shake out?

How did the game shake out?

We lost on the very last turn. We had the game and could have ended it with a small win, but didn’t realize the automa could win with a huge score by picking up a province tile and scoring all four yield tokens for a ton of points. So we let the game go one turn too long and ended up losing +17 to +9. We definitely felt like we had egg on our faces!
Jim

Yep! I enjoyed the design of the AI's rubberbanding/engine building, just like you the player can build up and set up a nice combo, so can the AI!
Glad to hear it was a tight race! So, you played 2 players + the AI? Cool!

Actually, we played as a two-person team against the AI. Playing a three-person competitive (as opposed to co-op) game with the AI as one of the players will be a future experiment!

Fun! I recommend if it's too easy to adjust by giving it only the money Yield tokens for its white yellow and red.

Hi Cell,
One question, when the AI goes to the tea market, what will be the score? The AI doesn't use the dice.

You look at its collection of province tiles and score ALL of its markets of that type, so the maximum.
I'll add it to the rulebook, thanks!

I've been using the mautomas bot for a while for solo play, but always lamented it's inability to handle the extra modules.  So I was very happy to see yours!
Gave it a spin. I threw in a couple things from each of the goodie boxes - Holi, Gem Dealers, Pink Elephant, and Mango Village.  It worked great ( I lost, lol).   But the deck made sense was easy to work with.  I especially like how the bot scores more naturally than just auto-adding points/fame at the end of each round.  Made it feel more like an opponent than just something to clog up worker placement spots and serve as an obstacle.
Thanks for the work on it!

Thanks so much, and thanks for the feedback! I'm glad it worked well for you!

I recently bought Rajas of the Ganges and was so pleased to find that you had produced a solo mode for it - it plays really well and I enjoy it very much. Thank you!
I also love the solo mode that you produced for Ark Nova and have just ordered Bitoku on the strength of your 'Daitengu' variant.

Oh awesome! I'm glad you enjoyed!
I appreciate your kind words!

I would love to see a reboot of this game with a bigger board, upgraded components and the markets nerfed. The game is so beloved, I think it would be an instabuy for many.

I couldn't disagree more. The game is amazing, just as is, and in my top 10. Throw in the two box expansions, and you have everything you could ever want. As the saying goes, "the best way to ruin a great movie is to make a sequel."

If you need your markets nerfed, simply don't score them when you put them on your tableau.
Anyway, I hope you get what you wish for, nevertheless.
Oh, my start player elephant is a little elephant figurine I got from an incense shop.

Not sure the game needs to be « upgraded » as I find it great looking as it is.
As for the market, I get what you mean but I still wouldn’t change it. I mean, it does seem kind of frustrating that the « no dice » market space becomes the focus of every player for easy points every turn they are first player at a certain point in the game (my perspective is from mostly 2 players games)
Nonetheless, although « race » games are not my usual cup of tea, this one I just love for that aspect. My experience is that when your opponent starts hitting that market spot, you better be in a a position to be competitive and not have slept at the wheel…
Yes, you can often see that your opponent can easily win the game within « x » turns simply because of that spot, but I don’t feel the market makes or break the game in itself. And you know that the next game things might be different.

I suggest you edit the thread subject and replace the ! with a ? .... right now it's click bait for those of us thinking a new version was coming

It is a glorious game, and sometimes when we love something we want even more of it, or we want changes so we can have another version of it. This is not that for me. The game is great as is. The dice game is great. Maybe they need a card version so we can have more platforms for it's amazement, or a small box version, etc. I don't think a redo is necessary personally, but I like your enthusiasm about the game.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Does anyone play Rajas with the restriction that roads on tiles MUST connect to another tile or the edge of the player board? I usually impose this restriction on myself because I like that extra bit of challenge and because I hate how it looks with dead end roads. I'd feel better about suggesting this 'house rule' if it were a common variant.

Not sure I get it. Since any tiles you put down in your province must « reach » the capital, it’s a given that it needs to connect to another tile…
Unless you mean that, in your variant roads on tiles need to connect to
all
adjacent tiles or border?
If so, to each his own and I hope you find kindred spirits.
If I can go so far as to give my opinion (I recognize it’s not what you actually asked and I hope I don’t come as rude by telling my peace), I just don’t think the game needs that; you need to make sure the tiles you are laying down are efficient; if you end up needing to choses the tile that pays less or fits the less in your strategy because it’s the only one you can afford and/or is available, I would be afraid it would be detrimental to the game itself.
All the games I have played ended up really really close and the challenge is that you just can’t have many bad turns, which I would be afraid this variant would maybe cause more of.

It is kind of hard to describe. Maybe I'll take out some tiles and take a picture.
What I mean is...
When you are placing a new tile, if it can connect to another tile, it must. For example, a straight line road with no intersection couldn't be adjacent to an intersection tile which leaves that intersection with nothing to connect to. Kind of like a Carcassonne placement rule. You can't have a road tile connected to a field with a dead end road.

The red board has a dead end. The yellow board does not. The way I like to play, the red board's placement would be illegal.



Correct, the game does not "need it." But I like that extra bit of challenge and aesthetic to my player board.

Yeah; that’s what I had figured.
Again; it’s cool that you like it and are having fun with it. I personally worry that it might make me choose less optimal tiles just because I want to make sure that everything « fits » down the line, but it would work both ways in a multiplayer game.
That would be a bigger challenge in the solo variant; have you ever tried it?

So,  I'm wondering if it's worth it to get both goodie boxes or simply get the tiger,  snake and mango expansions and leave it there?  Is there anything in the goodie boxes that are a must have or would be width it to have over the other option?
Thanks

In my opinion the basic game is good as is, but i bought the Goodie Box 1 and i can say that the modules are simple and easy to add
-The Ganga module only adds 2 river tiles: The dolphin (brings another earning) and a "two upgrades" tile. Very easy and fun to add.
.The Gemstone trader permits to change one die and is one of the favorites of my family,
-Tiger and the Snake modules can be permament in your setup due dont have any structural change only adds 1 province tile per player (each)
-Ther Mango Village is the star of this box, and add one more location on the game to obtain special province tiles, only a few extra rules.
.The test of fate is not popular with us and we dont use it.
If you can get the Box and play regularly, it's worth it. Otherwise you can pass and enjoy the game without them.

Hi, no i cant find the Box 2 anywhere. The box 1 was available on Amazon a few months ago.

Do you like anything in particular in that box?

We've (3 or 4 players) played a couple of times with the Goodie box 2, mixing stuff here and there.
I've bolded the ones we'll always play with and underlined the ones we'll sometimes play with:
1.
Holi festival
- it is a fun catch-up mechanism; made the middle game a little easier, resources wise
2.
Through the Wilds of Gangestan
(could actually be bolded, not sure) - a little bonus in the setup but makes tile laying a little bit more exciting because you gain an extra free tile in the middle of your estate
3.
The Pink Elephant
- a little boost to a worker spot no one ever takes; still rarely anyone takes it but sometimes it happens
4.
Ganga module 3
- no brainer, just a bunch of river tiles, we'll always mix them with previous ones for even more variety
5.
The Blessings of Kedarnath
- we'll always play with this, it gives you an interesting action choice, rewards planning a little bit
6.
The Sacred Cows
- just mix these four tiles with the rest of them, cool additions
7. The Roads of the Mogul Empire - the only module we've never played, seems that it helps with the overbuilding (we rarely do it): we'll try it next time
The only thing I don't like about these Goddie boxes are tiny multi language rulebooks. It would be awesome if someone can make one rulebook in English with all the information about all the expansions, easily searchable.

Thank you so much. Looks like getting the goodie boxes are more worth it than just the snake, tiger and mango alone. Appreciate the answers.

Do you like anything in particular in that box?

I haven't tried them yet

Goodie Box 1 is great and as described above. Recommended.
I have also GB2, but seems like full of catch-up mechanics. More dice for everyone, quicker head start etc. With all this stuff, I've got thirsty for plain old vanilla game without anything else. It was great too! So, I would say NO expansions are MUST here (even Mango Village is kind of simplifier - before them, there was bigger fight for marketplace and for first player on palace no1). Grab them if you have a chance for a good price, but sleep well without them too

I was wondering if anyone else has encountered the issue where the dice in this game become cracked. I've played my copy about 5 times, and almost all of the blue dice and some of the green dice have become cracked (have visible cracks, mostly internally). This doesn't affect gameplay but visually it's a bit of a bummer, since I find the dice an important part of this games great aesthetics.
Has anyone else experienced this? Is it worth trying to reach out to the publisher?

No problem with my dices since 2018 (20 plays).
You can try to reach out to the publisher...you will see.

Never heard of this problem
Sorry to hear that  . U could probably contant r&r for replacement dice

We played today and I just noticed that all the dice are cracked. The cracks start from the pips. Didn’t transport the game, wasn’t in heat or in the sun. The box has been waiting on the shelf in a normal temperature room which never gets hot. I am a bit dazzled as I have never seen this happening to dice.
I will reach out for replacements, or look for alternatives. Honestly right now they look awesome jewel-like when the light hits from behind, but they look like they may crack more and explode at any point.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ever since I really got into board games, Ive been logging my scores on this site/BG Stats App, and havent had an issue too much with figuring out what score to log after a game, until this one...
Now, since there 2 scoring tracks and when they intersect that triggers the end of the game, whoever has the "most distance" between the two after crossing over wins? (Only played it once, so my terminology might not be 100%) So in recording a score, would it be the difference?
Eg. I won by having: 48 Money - 38 Fame
Whereas my opponent had: 31 Money - 35 Fame
I just counted the "poles" between the two, and I had 3, where my opponent was -20. So would that be our scores? Or is there a better way? (attached an image below)

I don’t know what is the exact answer but seeing that, as you said, the tie breaker in case 2 players cross theIr token in the same turn is the number of spaces between said tokens, I would find your resolution the most logical one.
I am curious to see if there is any other answer.

When playing Rajas of the Ganges on
Yucata
.  Yucata uses a similar scoring but instead uses the fame track, so that your score is 1 and your opponents is -10.

When playing Rajas of the Ganges on
Yucata
.  Yucata uses a similar scoring but instead uses the fame track, so that your score is 1 and your opponents is -10.

Makes sense because I just read the rule book and it clearly states

If there are two or more players whose markers passed each other on their final turn, each of the players involved counts the difference of fame points between his money marker and his fame marker; the player with the most points wins the game.

So the Fame track is the actual « final » points tracker, which is probably why Yucatan used that scoring method.

oooh, thanks! Yeah felt like I was close, fame makes a lot of sense!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you only allowed to use karma to change the dice you are about to use?
Or may you karma at anytime on your turn to change a die face that is on your statue, not intending to use for that turn?

The rules say to use karma only when using a die.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is it legal to use one of the "market type" spaces if you have no markets of that type (simply to block someone else from using it)? I'm assuming the answer is yes, but just checking.

The rules don't mention anything about this so I would say you are allowed to. Specially in worker placement games, it is common to read in rules that players may not place their workers on a space they cannot at least partially complete the action for. This is an important details for the reason you mention.
Furthermore, your ship may land on a space that triggers market income when you have no market, I would consider that the same situation.

I tend to disagree, though I'm open to persuasion.  The rules have a general statement on worker placement, in that you place a worker, pay the cost if required and immediately take the action.  It doesn't explicitly say you must be able to do the action, but I think that's unnecessary if it says you immediately take the action.  Not being able to take the action or having zero markets doesn't constitute taking the action.
The river action is different, in that you have at least advanced your boat, so you have done the action that placing the worker required (the boat is not your worker).
Edit: It seems popular opinion differs from mine, according to several previous threads asking the same question:

Hi
This is the context:
It's my turn, i have two dice and 2 karma.
I'd like to change the value of both dice, meaning my karma will go to 0.
Am I allowed to do this? Or is it possible to change the value of ONE die only (per turn)?
Thank you for reading

Yes you can use multiple karma in a turn.  So if you had 2 2-die and 2 karma, you could turn them both to 5s to play a 10 tile.  For example

Hi
thank you so much!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Played this last night so haven't gotten enough plays to experience the variability but wondering if anybody has ever tried a looping river variant. As in when you finish the river you end up back at the start. Not sure how it would play out but one person raced to the end then couldn't use the river anymore. I'm always a fan of different viable styles to play games. In this way you could play the river fast or slow, or some variation between. I might give it a try myself once we've played a few times but would like to see if anyone else had the thought or tried

I don't see a particular problem doing that, but the river actions scale as you're further along so the pacing would seem weird to me.

I am not sure if this would be balanced, because part of mastering this game is to know when to move how far on the river and when to claim the extra worker on the bridge. If it was allowed to go back to the start, then every player would probably just use the palace action with the number six die as often and as soon as they can to claim that worker and then go back easily to benefit from all the other bonuses. (I have already played this game quite a few times.) But you could always try your own variant and adopt it, if you like it.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On advanced side bottom is the top yellow space one green and one fame or is it obtain green dice equal to karma?

On advanced side bottom is the top yellow space one green and one fame or is it obtain green dice equal to karma?

Neither.  It's obtain 1 green die and 1 karma.

On advanced side bottom is the top yellow space one green and one fame or is it obtain green dice equal to karma?

ah this one (?) which I just came in to find the answer to



Neither.  It's obtain 1 green die and 1 karma.

makes sense!  it's just so close to the other places like on river and actually mentioned in rule book where you get 0-3 dice based on karma level
out of curiosity other than now being more obvious is this reward actually pictured/descripted in the rulebook?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Is this what Mango village is for? How anyone tried nerfing a different way? Reducing income by 1 coin per market activitated, etc.

I rarely use those market spots and often win the game. I don't think any nefring is needed, so I never thought about that.

In most of my online plays these spots are used first as a matter of course. Most forum chat seems to back this up. I'm surprised but interested to hear a differing opinion.

We use a die of value 3 to score three different markets. A 2 for two markets.
If my memory doesn’t fail me, this is somewhere posted in the forum

My view has been slowly changing on this as I used to agree; but last time out I won without using that space at all.
In my early plays of Raja's I'd seen this space used to good effect. It seemed pretty obvious that these spots combined with a few different markets was easily beating a FAME strategy. The game wasn't balanced. Those spots were too powerful. Why didn't they need a dice to activate? Makes it too important the value of pips you get as you need to get those tiles etc etc.
What changed it for me was the realisation that this isn't really a FAME vs Money strategy game. Money is going to be important regardless. Fame is important regardless. The track bonuses and how you unlock workers kind of spells that out. But different markets isn't the only way to generate that income. The goods specific markets are also very powerful in the late game, easily generating 10+ money.  Furthermore if I have done well in, say silk markets, then you probably haven't and so there is less natural competition for the space. I can go there with my later workers.
My advice is to try playing this game with the mindset that you need to get into those markets, whether its the like-markets or the specific ones. A player that ignores them is giving a double whammy to their opponent in that they aren't competing on tiles and then not competing on the spaces. If you are doing that you probably aren't going to win.
So I used to play thinking that market route looked a bit too obvious and I wanted to find a deeper route to victory. But this game is much better when everyone realises the value of those spaces and competes for them. Don't look for the game to balance those spots on its own.
If you want something deeper with multiple branching paths, this isn't that. And that's exactly the sort of game I prefer. But this is staying in the collection because its a great 60 min light/medium game.

I appreciate the thoughtful and thorough response. Thanks!

I don’t agree with the previous posters.  This spot not requiring a dice makes it too good.  I still love the game, but once you have 4-5 workers, being able to generate 7-8 money without using a dice is the best spot on the board.

I don’t agree with the previous posters.  This spot not requiring a dice makes it too good.  I still love the game, but once you have 4-5 workers, being able to generate 7-8 money without using a dice is the best spot on the board.

It is definitely the best spot for money/fame. But if you can generate 7-8 money, others can likely do so too (or at least 5 coins which is still worth it). Hence, you will only have first dibs on the spot half of the time. Same chance for everyone.
And it's not like rushing for 3 different markets is the only way to win. Most importantly, dice rolls and tile reveals are not always in your favour - just because you want 3 different markets doesn't mean you will get them. The circumstances may direct you to a 1/2 fame 1/2 money strategy (e.g. you roll 4s, the market tiles are straights or bends). Being fixated on a strategy is recipe for failure.
Secondly, others can target the tiles you want. Thirdly, specialised market (as mentioned by Mike) and fame building (e.g. building a cheap monument then overbuilding with the '5' dice Master Builder) are also viable.
Once everyone respects the '3 different markets' spots, it just becomes an auto pick spot then you still have a few other dice to make meaningful decisions
side note: I think getting the Great Mogul (#1) is generally not worthwhile because most river spots are worth more than 2 fames or it can be converted to a '6' for Portugese or building tiles.

i think I played it that you do not gain coins when you place the market on your board (like you do with buildings), but rather only collect when you visit the market spots.  Not gaining the coins when you place the market nerfs them only slightly but its a simple yet effective way to reduce their value slightly.

I haven't played the game (just reading through in preparation for my/our first play) and the discussion reminds me of discussions for St. Petersberg when it came out "The Aristocrats are too strong!" ....which, IMO, completely misunderstood the game.  Positioning yourself to take Aristocrats WAS the game. It's where the tension came from. Do I take a Building into my hand in order to free up a space for adding another Aristocrat so I'm able to pick one up?  But then my hand is clogged...."  Obviously there are differences here, but it still struck me as similar.  We, as gamers, seem to want to be able to 100% avoid a particular strategy and still win, saying a particular part of the game is too strong because you can't win if you avoid doing that thing....well, maybe the designers didn't want you to be able to avoid doing that thing. It's a constraint that you have to manage around. Deciding when you can deviate a bit IS one of the main decision points they wanted you to face.

We’re going to try it where if you go there, you have to get rid of a die of your choice instead of it being free. Makes you think a little more about the decision.

Is anyone aware of a unified player add that has all the iconagraphy and explanations for base game and goodie boxes in one file?
Thanks in advance!
Scott


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question in title. I'm assuming the mango village action spot only fires 2 mango village tiles not any building tile (these are called province tiles). Is this correct?
Thanks in advance!
Scott

I believe so. From memory the wording refers to "village" tiles and I don't think the other tiles are ever referred to as villages.

Yes, can only fire mango tiles and up to 2 of them


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I like this game alot and just picked up both goodie boxes. Rather than exploring ALL the myriad variants, I am looking for a tweaked version of the base game that gives viable options beyond hammering the (no dice) market spots and the '2' spot. Hitting those spots in the basic game just seems a little uninteresting for such a vibrant game that has so much to offer. It does seem like the Navaratnas variant helps nerf the '2' spot.
For those that have tried all the variants that come in the goodie boxes, which do you recommend for a 'preferred' or 'tweaked' version of the base game. Any and all thoughts are welcome.  Thanks in advance!
Planning to add:
- variety in ocean tiles is good (mix in all Gagna tiles). Include all new tiles? What's the best way to integrate them to add variability? The 'Drying Up' variant of removing river spots seems interesting.
- adding more building tiles (mango village tiles, snake, tiger, & cow)
- mango tree tile: Does this add a viable strategy or at least additional very useful action spot to compete with the (no dice) market spots?
- Kedarnath (new karma track) seems interesting
- Through the Wilds of Gangestan seems interesting
I was planning to skip (seem to add unnecessary complexity/rules overhead):
- No to 'Test of Fate' from GB1 and Holi festival in GB2 (catch-up mechanics).
- No to Gemstone trader (claim special worker which can be used to alter a die)
- No to Roads of Mogul Empire (flag markers, etc.)
- No to Pink Elephant.

I don't think using the no die market spot is too powerful. It is just a strong move when you are close to winning. It makes you money, which is the slower way to get your tokens to meet and it is often spent during the game.

FYI, I've got a separate post discussing nerfing the market spots specifically, this thread was more about the goodie box modules.

I find it just as effective long term to get the prestige levels high, then build and overbuild to ramp up the movement on the prestige track.

Rick,
I agree. Last time out I used the prestige levels for good fame moves, and then overbuilt with like-markets and was rinsing them for 12 cash uncontested. Lol.
I hadn't really tried over-building before and nor had I gone hard and fast at the same type of markets before. Both proved useful in getting the win!
In terms of modules - I think the 'advanced' rules in the core box is the only real option as its only marginally more complex than the basic. We also tend to randomise the river which often covers up a couple of those later game market conversion spots. I have used Mango village but I'm not convinced it improves the market situation or needs to. Really it just provides ANOTHER way to go at tiles and reduces competition on the existing markets.
Interested to hear what other goodies are worth using.

When placing a worker (assuming you can pay the cost of the space if necessary), do you have to take the action fully, or be able to take the action fully?  Can I choose to do a partial action?  Example: I go to the Yogi space in the palace and take one dice, but no karma because I am at my max karma on the track, or I just don't want to (which would be odd...I know).

If you can't store a particular thing then it just forfeits.
You can take the action but if your Karma track is on max you simply don't get any more.

Interesting question. Why wouldn't one want to? Is there a situation where this would be a benefit? Is there any space you wouldn't want the full benefit? I can only see this being a thing if I wanted my opponent to win for some reason!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have only played Rajas once at 2p and I must say that I found it to be an utterly underwhelming and overly frustrating experience.
The problem with Rajas is that it overwhelmingly relies on luck. Not the sort of fun luck you'll find in Camel Up or Quacks of Quedlinburg but the sort of luck that makes you wanna flip the table. There is no question that the most important aspect of the game is your personal player board. This is your engine that drives your money and karma production and if it isn't impressive, you're simply not gonna win. How does one make an impressive player board? With lots of dice pips, which means you either need a lot of dice or to roll well. If your opponent rolls better that you or happens to pick up all of the bonus tiles that award extra dice they will leave you for dead, and that's exactly what happened in my game. Sure there are ways to mitigate poor dice rolls with the use of "karma" but it just isn't enough as karma itself is costly and hard to come by.
In my game I never felt like I had a chance of winning, yet I feel like I played as well as I could have with what I had. I absolutely do not feel that I had any chance of winning the game with my dice rolls and bonus tiles draws when compared to my opponent's. My choices just seemed to have little to no agency; all the agency was in the dice rolls and that just isn't fun for me
There are some interesting ideas in here, but that's about it. The interacting fame/money tracks seem interesting at first glance but when you really think about it it turns out that it could've just been one track, not two. If something were to award you with one fame, it could've just been two dollars (or rupees) to the same effect. Sure, there are bonuses to be had as you progress along the individual tracks but that only serves to force you to attempt "a little bit of everything" and dis-incentivizes focusing on one particular strategy.
Overall, Rajas is a very generic, bland euro game with far too much dependence on luck. In my game it never felt like I was playing against my opponent, but rather I was playing against the game and the game was being much, much nicer to my opponent than it was to me. I would be hard pressed to play this again.

Totally the opposite of every play I've had of this, including my first. The game has less luck than a lot of games using dice. Some spots can only be visited with low rolls and many of them are powerful. Maybe you just don't understand the game and can't figure out how to value what those options are? Whatever the reason, it's not the game's fault. Raja is a top 10 all-time game for me and is likely to remain that way.

Rajas was such a hit with me, I play against a difficult automa I printed cards for and have played multiplayer. There were always things to do with different dice, high or low, and everything is cleverly put together.
So you have only played once at two player, have you played any other ways? Maybe it was just a really unlucky game and your opponent was luckier and also stole the areas you'd want, before you.
If there was only one track it wouldn't be that much fun.... A lot would seem odd too, spending money to gain more money? Fame and crossing on the track make it more fun. The Dice Charmers version of this game is also super fun. I always wrote this off since I am a solo player, but always wanted the game. So glad I found the automa and then did end up recruiting newbie type gamers. Easy to teach and understand. This game instantly jumped into my top nine.
What are some games you love, so we know if it is even your style? To each their own of course!

I know that some of the low dice-roll spaces are "valuable", but not nearly as valuable as buying good tiles. I doubt one could ever win this game with consistently low die rolls.

" Maybe it was just a really unlucky game and your opponent was luckier" - exactly my point.

" Maybe it was just a really unlucky game and your opponent was luckier" - exactly my point.

Ah yes, but dice rolling isn't often so perfectly one sided, so my point is that your first experience is more of a fluke than an actual measure of how the game usually plays. I mean, of course it's your right to dislike it and find is disappointing. I just think your first game sounds like a fluke. The game is usually tight and not such a runaway win/loss.

Also it does seem very Euro-introductory, but I love the simplicity and easy to figure out iconography. Easy to teach to newer gamers interesting in expanding. I also love the roll of dice. Maybe one of the goodies boxes would fix the problems you are having. I am going to look closer at them for myself.

The problem with Rajas is that it overwhelmingly relies on luck.

No it doesn't. It's a dice-driven game, and like all dice-driven games there is an inherent amount of randomness (or 'luck' as you call it).
But "overwhelmingly" reliant on luck? No, because there are multiple ways to mitigate dice values that aren't working for you, and Karma is just one of them. You have one particular dice that isn't working for you? Trade it for 2 other different colored dice and get a fresh roll. There are good spots for low value dice rolls as well as higher value ones.
As for building up your player board, start modestly and work your way up - the default presentation of the tiles is very even and fair in that there should always be something you can afford to build. It may not be the perfect tile for you at that given moment (it rarely is) but a creative player should be able to find a way to make something work.

I would be hard pressed to play this again.

That's too bad. It really is a terrific game but if you're confident that one play was enough to put you off for good, then it is what it is.

I know that some of the low dice-roll spaces are "valuable", but not nearly as valuable as buying good tiles. I doubt one could ever win this game with consistently low die rolls.

It took me a bit to figure out how to finagle this scenario, but the key is karma and the river.  If you can time out your karma right, you can snag a bunch of low value tiles to get your bonuses. The two space is also seriously useful in these scenarios since you can get up to three dice of your choice.  Additionally, don't feel bad if you take the re-roll action, it's not great, but a bit of cash in your pocket and a better roll can be a good thing.
Weirdly enough, I tend to struggle with consistent high value rolls, particularly in early game.

Yeah, these are all somewhat valid points, but if I'm having to take all these actions trying to get more dice and reroll my low value dice while my partner is not then I'm inherently at a disadvantage. Not to mention that they consistently picked up extra dice with the 2-pip die action while I was getting the less-useful bonuses. It was not a level playing field. Maybe its just a me problem though because I don't like luck in my euros. And you may call it randomness, but I definitely call it bad luck when I pick 4 dice and roll thee ones and one two when I'm specifically in need of high numbers, and have already used up all my karma on my earlier lousy rolls.

My experience with the game is the opposite of the OP. We bought it shortly after we played it. We enjoy dice rolling games, even when we roll bad (my wife is the queen of bad rolling), but she enjoys this one with me.
Too bad you (OP) didn't like it, but to each his own.

Thanks for your post. Always good to read a less favourable but well presented opinion.
I enjoy Raja’s, but for me the strength of the markets and getting the right dice to grab a set is more of an issue than simply pip value. Markets can be really strong and there’s this forced tension of feeling like you have to get market sets otherwise someone else will and they’ll spin up an engine and pull away. Rather than have other directions to go in.
It comes up in various threads and I’m not sure I’ve ever been completely satisfied by the arguments that the game is fine as is. So I find it hard to grab it off the shelf.
The problem may be mine. I tend to play games in a way where I avoid strategies that look obviously strong. I don’t know why, but I just don’t want to be doing the obvious moves all the time because then I don’t really have any agency. It’s scripted. The last few games of ignoring an obvious market grab have left me way behind the pace, watching people accumulate money quickly whilst my engine stalls.
The argument seems to be that Raja’s isn’t a game of diverse strategies. Its a game of balance. Sometimes you have to take those tiles because otherwise you are being suboptimal and leaving a great move for someone else. And I guess I should play with that mindset and enjoy the tension around the scramble for “good” tiles.
But to bring this full circle, therein lies the luck part of the game for me. If a great tile comes up and I convert one dice to two of the colour I need and I get low values, it’s taken too long to nab the tile before someone else snaffles it.
Sure there’s karma and keeping a good dice pool, but as the OP alludes to, sometimes it feels like you’ve been situationally shafted when it really does matter that you roll high.
All of this does make me want to play it again though lol…

Rather than have other directions to go in.

In my opinion, this is a bit of a problem and people often make weak arguments when dismissing it that don't really hold up in practice. I think the main issue is that there are a lot of opportunities to use your markets over and over again while simultaneously making the action stronger every round, but not that many opportunities to make your building scoring ramp up in the same way. You can counter it a little bit by blocking market spaces, but this can also be to your detriment because you effectively lose a turn if you aren't also going for markets.
I found that some of the mini-expansions fix this issue by simply introducing more options to upgrade your building scoring throughout the game. They also mix in some powerful tiles that make the other player think twice about blindly going for the high value market tiles, because then they might leave you a tile which has good synergy with fame scoring, leaving you to create a similar runaway scenario like they are trying to do with their high value market tiles. I've already played one three-player game where my opponent completely ignored me while building his wealth engine, and in the final two rounds I ran nearly two-thirds of the fame track and won by a landslide.

I have to disagree. There is a constant flow of dice and I cannot see how you can be unlucky all the time. There are 2 powerful strategies: going for markets or going for buildings. In a 2 player games if you go for the opposite of what your oponent is doing or focus on one of those strategies if your oponent is doing a little bit of both you have many chances to win. You need to use wisely your buildings and your workers. I will give you that sometimes you run out of dice and luck, but you have to build up your engine and understand that your oponents will also eventually run out of dice and luck. I mean, you roll tens of dice in this game, it is statistically impossible to always run out of luck. Seems to me that you have to give it another chance and find a strategy that fits your play. In the end if you lose by a little bit for a bad roll at least you had a great time competing.

My take away is that you should stay away from games with dice.

Well that’s good advice to avoid disappointment, but is a case of throwing the baby out with the bath water.
There’s a whole spectrum of how much the dice in games can affect the outcome. At one end would be something like roll a 1-3 you lose, 4-6 you win. At the other would be a game where the dice create chaos but in a perfectly balanced way.
I agree that Rajas is more to the latter end, but I do think that my biggest gripe (the importance of being able to get the set of market tiles) is exacerbated by needing certain values of certain dice at the right time.
If the markets felt a little less “required” then I’d be way more willing to accept that enough dice are rolled that whoever navigates the chaos, by whatever route, is more often than not the worthy winner.
So in my view the dice aren’t the problem per se, but combined with the requirement for certain values at important times, they can cause frustration, exactly per the OPs reference to the player board engine.
This is a light to medium euro though, and for many all of that isn’t going to hamper their enjoyment.
Like I said before, all this does have me thinking I should give it a run again. And try to suppress my need to not be “cheesy”. It could be my bloody minded refusal to do the obvious thing in the hope there’s more divergent paths that’s the issue. Maybe it’s just a narrower game than I wanted it to be and preparing for those tiles and exploiting them, along with all other players trying to do the same, will create the natural balance i’m looking for regardless of dice rolls.

If you think the game is all about the player board and only high dice rolls matter than you are not analyzing the game deep enough. You are just looking at what on the surface level of what you "think" is most important. The river bonuses and palace spots are very strong.
The two tracks are different because they have different bonuses along the way. Money gives you a lot of bonuses throughout the game. Fame gives you additional ability to get fame early on and access to another worker.
The way you play against the opponent is to look at their board and color/value of dice and use that to anticipate what they may be trying to do. Then either get there first or play around it.

Rajas is one of my favourite games. What I like about it is that you still have options if you get low dice values. The number Two palace spot is very strong as is the river. Also you have Karma to mitigate the dice you get.  Don’t forget tile overbuilding which can be very strong in certain circumstances as you only have to pay the difference. For the different market space you don’t even need a dice. It shines at higher player counts.

@rizzou
No, you are right, and I certainly don’t think it’s only about high rolls. Nor do I think the player board is the only consideration. I get the variety of options, and i know the river can combo very nicely with other stuff.
I have sympathy for the OP, even if I don’t agree entirely.
From around a dozen plays, mostly 2p but not exclusively, in the vast majority of games the player that exploited the assorted market the most won. That’s my issue.
So subjectively, but with some supporting data, tiles that provide a variety of market goods of 2 or 3 coins each are more important. And they require certain dice colours and values. And therefore there will be occasions where I have to spend a couple of turns working to get the dice pips I need to get the tiles I really want, and I don’t get them. In a 2 player game that can be swingy if you miss and they hit.
The OP had quickly identified situations where they wanted certain values and were frustrated not getting them. I agree that in many of those situations there were probably equally good options away from building tiles, but I’d also bet some of those situations were where they wanted those juicy market tiles and our thoughts on the game align.
@grandpawizard had said there’s rarely a runaway winner and again that’s not my experience where one player is able to get ahead with those markets. Many times I was happy to call the game 2/3 of the way through because it was crystal clear who would win.
But some of this is personal taste. A lot of people love this game. And I have enjoyed the puzzle at times even though I felt it was a touch flawed as a competition. Just the other day I was reading Caroline’s recent blog post (subscribe if you haven’t already people!) where Rajas got a good mention.
I for example really enjoy Spacecorp, a game that takes 2.5 hrs and has objectively bad tile draws. Why am I ok with that and less inclined to let it slide here? Who knows? We are a funny bunch!
@CarolineBlack - perhaps player count is part of the problem. I only had a handful of games at higher counts and pretty much every one of those games had one or two new players. Maybe the game needs players to know about, and to fight for, the market goods tiles to spread them around and keep those who don’t get them in touch. Much in the same way auction games often don’t work if one or more of the players are inexperienced and throw out the balance.

Well articulated. This is quite literally what happened to me. I just couldn't get a good market set!

My take away is that you should stay away from games with dice.

There are plenty of games that I love that use dice well. Most notable Castles of Burgundy, which may not be a perfect system but does offer much better ways to mitigate bad dice rolls.

As you said, the game depends on players knowing which tiles are good and fighting over them. In fact, in a 2p game you have less reason to say you find yourself locked out of a good tile because the available tiles only change by at most 1 between ur turns. It should be apparent when your opponent will get the good tile before you (and you should plan for another good tile).
Regarding the '3 market' location, you have 50% first pick. Unless your opponent picked the '1' dice location which I don't find a good use most of the time because you can convert it to a '6' and jump 6 River spaces. Compelling to get markets, yes, but not OP.
Yes runaway games are possible because this game is maybe 70% skill.

The market being over-centralizing to me is a feature of the game, not a bug.
Many euro gamers seem to have the expectation that each "path of victory" needs to be perfectly balanced. But there is nothing wrong with having certain paths be more desirable and thus skew the game towards them. Particularly in a worker placement game where you can strategize and "fight" over it, it just adds a different dimension to the game rather than just letting everyone spread out and avoid each other.

My current rating for this game is 7/10 (Good Usually Willing to Play). Rajas helped my partner and I to try heavier euros because even though it is not a very complex game, it looks a bit overwhelming. It kind of demystified euros in our household. Good game, I have not tried the expansions yet, but I would like to.

Mango Village is okay. If u want to play a more forgiving game, try it. Those tiles require two dice of same number so even your double '1's can be put to good use. And also, the tiles are 4-way.
I personally prefer a tighter game with trade-off between good market tile (low dice total but 2 or 3 way) and 4-way bad tiles.

I was wondering if anyone had any thematic ideas on how to deluxify the boring upgrade cubes or the fame/money markers.  Thanks I advance!

I haven't done anything with the cubes, but I did 3D-print
this Ganesh
in gold for a first player marker.  With everything else going on on the board I don't find that the wooden bits are that much of a distraction.

Which solo variant has stood the test of time? I see two versions posted four years ago. One has printable cards and the other rolls a die. Has anyone tried both? Are there others? It is overwhelming to learn so many versions so I am hoping to just go with which has been the fan favorite. Thanks!

I've tried both, and preferred the card-based variant.  But it's been a few years ago so my memory is hazy as to why.  Nonetheless, I liked the card variant enough to put it on my solo 10x10 list this year.

Thank you!! Looks like I’ll be making cards! I was leaning towards that idea. And it sounds like a fun project.

I also really like the card solo mode. I find it pretty challenging and fairly easy to handle so it doesn’t take much time to operate.

I did end up getting the game and printing the cards. They are so amazing and easy to operate. I never wanted to put the game away but I am trying to chip away at my Shelf of Shame. I will go back to it in between games. Also loving Dice Charmers.

I have tried MAUTOMAS solo variant (card based automa). It's excellent and plays so smoothly. Really great work. Only the difficulty at hard is too easy imo. But this can easily be adjusted by giving the automa more fame per round.

We tried to play this for the first time tonight (2 player), but ran into a problem. My game board has the layout for 3-4 players on both sides of the board. Completely identical on both sides.
I found images of the 2 player board online and it's clearly different (fewer spaces for the river and the markets). I clearly have a misprinted board, but I can't find any mention of that on the Geek or elsewhere. Has anyone else run into this?

Just contact the publisher for a replacement board.

It would be easier if you take it back to the shop. They should offer a replacement. It is clearly a faulty copy. Your retailer should be the first point of contact.

That’s not a misprint though.

Sadly I bought it at the BGG.CON flea market, so that's not an option. I can try contacting the publisher, for sure.

That’s not a misprint though.

Are you saying that Rajas should not be played 2 player because it's not good at that player count, or something else?

The board should have a 2-player side and a 3/4 player side indeed. Sounds like a misprint to me.

That’s not a misprint though.

Are you saying that Rajas should not be played 2 player because it's not good at that player count, or something else?

No, the board should have a 2p side. Yours is
misglued
. I wonder how that happened, the process of producing boards is probably automated.
Good luck getting the replacement, it’s certainly worth the effort.

I did contact the publisher, and they promptly sent me a replacement board - with the two different sides.
So I have a spare board with only the 3-4 player side (twice), if anyone wants it for any reason.

Is there a 5th player expansion

There isn't.

Is there a 5th player expansion

fwiw for any game if you click on the 'expansions' tab it will show you the expansions... for this game there are 9 of them (most 'mini' sized I think)
https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/220877/rajas-ganges/expa...

THANKS

I have goodie box one, no 5th player, but each of teh mini expansions adds enough just to change teh flavour a bit and make the decisions a bit different, they are well worth it.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Plays: 4 at player counts: 2 + 3
Appearance
The front of the box shows a beautiful landscape and river with a deity holding dice and is full of colour and detail. The back of the box shows a 2 player game in progress showcasing the majority of the components and gives a description of the theme of the game. The game has a good insert which holds the components well and makes setup a lot quicker. The player boards are well laid out but a little bland until you lay tiles on them during the game. The tiles are more detailed with various spices and buildings, along with a large number and colour to denote what they require to be built. The wooden coloured player components are easy to distinguish from one another and include some shaped meeples along with some bland cubes. The main board is a particular highlight of the components, it is very colourful and detailed and doesn’t look overwhelming. Finally the dice are very good quality in bright colours with a nice weight to them.
Gameplay
The aim of the game is to make your fame and wealth track markers intersect one another, these run in parallel around the board in opposite directions. When a player’s 2 markers intersect the end of the game is triggered, with the player with the biggest difference between the 2 markers winning if multiple player’s tokens intersected. Each turn players will place workers, pay any costs associated with the spot and carry out the action listed. These costs vary from moving back on the money track to paying a specific colour or numbered dice. Players will continue to place workers until all workers have been placed and the board will then reset with players collecting back all their workers and the next round can begin as long as the end game hasn’t been triggered.
There are 4 main different worker placement areas: the quarry, market place, palace and harbour. Using the quarry worker area you can build a province tile into your personal province. There are 12 different province tiles on offer at any time, 3 for each different coloured dice. Your must pay the listed money cost when placing your worker along with matching coloured dice of equal to or greater pip value than the tile you are acquiring. You must place these tiles with a direct path back to your starting palace on your province. You gain any yields that you connect to on the edge of your province and receive the money from any markets on the tile. You also receive fame for any buildings on the tile based on your position on that buildings scroll track on the main board, so between 2 and 4 fame. There are various actions and bonuses on the board that allow you to move up on the 4 building scroll tracks.
The market worker area allows you to collect income from the markets in your province, either from the same type of market or different ones. When activating the same market you must pay a dice and can only activate as many markets as the pip value of the dice. The palace has 3 main areas the terrace, balconies and the chamber. In the terrace and balconies you can either collect a specific coloured dice of your choice or trade one coloured dice for 2 of a different coloured dice. Whenever you collect dice you roll them and place them onto your Kali statue if you have room. You can always spend karma (if you have it) to flip a dice when you need to pay a cost. In the chambers you can spend a dice of a specific number to activate one of the characters for a specific action. These include gaining dice, karma, scroll movement, taking first player and building over province tiles in your area.
In the harbour you can move your boat 1 to 3 spaces on the river and take the listed bonus on the space you end your movement on. The amount of spaces you move depends on the value of the dice spent. Boats cannot be on the same space and you simply skip spaces opponents boats are present on. The bonuses are very similar to the other actions on the board but towards the end reward dice, money or fame based on a condition such as number of karma, scroll movement or markets built in your province. You start the game with 3 workers but can unlock up to 3 more from the fame, money and river tracks when your corresponding marker passes them. Play continues until the end of the game when one player’s score markers intersect. Play continues until every player has played an even number of turns and then the winner is determined. The turns flow very naturally in this game with simple to resolve actions and costs to pay. The game plays 2 to 4 players and an unofficial solo automa is also available on bgg.
Theme and Game Length
The game has a good theme, different to many other Euro games of this weight but it doesn’t really come through in the actions you are performing. Why are you trying to get wealth and fame to meet, who are these characters and why does the river give the bonuses it does. Gaining workers makes slightly more sense as when you get more famous on the 3 tracks more people are willing to work for your province. The game doesn’t drag at all and is actually quite fast for the level of decisions offered. The game scales well with 2 different sizes of the board to tighten up the worker placement spots. The game takes about 20 minutes per player which is very good considering the weight of decisions you make.
Strategy
There are two main ways to score points in this game, wealth and fame. It is very hard to just work on just one of these and win so over the course of the game you will be earning both. Players will differ in their overall strategy but there is only the one way to win, intersecting your markers. A focus you must have is to get more workers as quickly as possible. The two workers that can be unlocked on the wealth and fame tracks are the easiest to obtain. The wealth track also offers multiple other bonuses so is the track you should target at the start of the game. If other players have more workers than you for too long you have no chance of winning with the yield tiles offering too little in compensation for the worker placement actions they are taking.
Each fame is worth 2 money so this obviously looks more appealing to try and race up but without the track bonuses this shouldn’t be an early game focus. Instead you should look to increase your scrolls for the 4 building types. If you specialise in one or two building types other players may build tiles with that building type to prevent you from building it. Also with 4 different building types the tiles that may come out may not be the ones you get extra fame for so it’s probably best to spread your scroll movement out. A space that you cannot underestimate is the space to activate up to 3 different markets in your province. You want to make sure to build 3 different high value markets as soon as possible to take advantage of this space. This spot (or spots in the 3/4 player games) is usually the first spot players go to at the start of each round from the mid game onwards. It costs no dice and can yield anywhere from 3 to 9 money which is better than any other spot due to having no costs. Activating multiple markets of the same type can also be good but requires a lot of the same market to be built which depends a lot of the tiles that come out.
Many of the spots cost dice of various values with every value having a potential good use. If you get lots of high value dice you should be using these to build tiles, trying not to waste too much pip value. The lower value dice can be used for some of the characters or more likely the river. The river is sort of split into two halves by your unlockable worker with the first half offering small bonuses like dice, scroll movement and fame. The later half offers powerful one off bonuses like activating multiple markets or gaining fame and money based on a condition. It is perfectly viable to skip most of the early bonuses and plan to maximise these powerful one off bonuses instead. With so many spots costing dice you always want to make sure you don’t run out. You should never take the terrace actions to gain one dice as it is so inefficient and should instead look to use bonuses to acquire dice or trade one dice for two. In the higher player count games you also want to make sure you are not 3rd or 4th in turn order for long due to some worker placement spots being clearly better than others and you can really fall behind if you are not careful.
There have been some runaway leader problems in the games that I have played of this. During the mid game it became obvious who was going to win generally because of the market setup they had on their board. This meant one worker could gain them 6 – 12 money with each action which was much stronger than the other players. Newer players will struggle with experienced players with both tracks to manage and not being able to distinguish which worker placement spots are better than others. The game has modest replayability as you are aiming to do the same thing each time and the way the tiles come out and what dice values you get will change each game. The game also comes with several modules which significantly help replayability and make the game better in my opinion with ways to customise your province. The game can end very suddenly and can be difficult to plan for so you need to be building towards the end of the game constantly.
Accessibility
The game is light to medium weight with simple to perform and resolve actions but some setup on your province tile required to do well. There is also some consideration needed for when and where to place your workers to maximise their benefits. The game is very easy to teach with obvious iconography and the main board layout also helps. The rulebook is excellent, very clearly laid out rules with multiple examples and text descriptions of each worker placement spot. The game takes up a decent amount of table space with each player’s province, the main board and places for tiles and dice.
Final Thoughts
Rajas of the Ganges is a good next step worker placement Euro game with simple to understand rules and great components. The game has good flow to it with your points increasing steadily before exploding towards the end. One of my main problems is the market space on the main board especially the activate 3 different ones in your province. This is way too strong due to having no cost and makes first player way too powerful in this game with players needing to shift it multiple rounds in a row to mitigate this. I really like the scoring in this game it’s fairly unique and offers different considerations unlike normal Euro style games. I also like the fact that all values of dice have uses in this game so even though low numbers aren’t good for building you can use them on characters and the river or to trade. A solid light to medium weight game.

For the advanced game, after you have used a yield tile, can you subsequently replace it with another one (through the dancer), then overbuild your connect to that same spot again?

p22
Attention! Always score for the province tile first before you take the special
yield.
You may not move or cover yield tiles already placed on the board
.

Yes, i saw that rule, but i was wondering if after the yield tile is used, it gets removed from the board (i think there is a part of the rule book that says to keep the used yield tiles in a stack for potential scoring).
So after the yield tiles have been used an removed, freeing up the yield space.. can it be replace with a new one?

Yes, i saw that rule, but i was wondering if after the yield tile is used, it gets removed from the board (i think there is a part of the rule book that says to keep the used yield tiles in a stack for potential scoring).

I can't find anything about that in the rulebook, except in reference to the Dancer, where it's referring to the basic version of the game. In that version you score a yield tile as soon as you take it, then you discard it.
In the Navaratnas version (which is the one where you place yield tiles on your board) there is no discarding. Yield tiles remain on your board once placed, until the end of the game.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the rules is written:
If you get into a situation that would get you more dice, you either take fewer dice or put dice from your Kali statue back into the general supply before taking new ones.
What exactly does that mean for the order of steps you traverse, if you get more dice, than you can store on your Kali statue? I assume the following, please confirm or object:
(1) I perform the action, which gives me new dice.
(2) I decide, which of the new dice I keep and which I forfeit.
(3) I roll the new dice, which I have kept.
(4) I decide, which of my old dice I forfeit in favor of the new dice.
I am quite sure, that (2) must come before (3) and (4). But especially, I am not sure, if (3) and (4) must be swapped perhaps.

In the rules is written:
If you get into a situation that would get you more dice, you either take fewer dice or put dice from your Kali statue back into the general supply before taking new ones.

Hi Frank
The way I read that is that you have to decide which dice to keep / lose, before rolling any new ones. This would also IMO prevent you taking a new die, rolling it, getting rid of it, then taking another new die.
So I believe 4 and 2 are decided together, only then do you roll any new dice in 3
Regards
Ian

If your action lets you take more dice than you have room for, you decide how many dice you will actually take. If you choose to take more dice than you have room for, you decide which of the dice you currently have you will discard. All of this happens
before
you choose or roll any of the new dice.

Please note, that even in my order suggestion it would be impossible to first roll a die and then getting rid of this die in the case of an unwanted result.
But I see your point, that the RAW support, that (3) and (4) should be swapped. This would be super brutal though, because then it is practically impossible, to purposefully replace a die of a certain color with a die of the same color but a higher value.

Definitely (4) before (3).
Yes, it's brutal - but really it is a punishment for a mistake. Dice are the most important resource in Rajas, you should generally never drop one because of overflow.

Hi all,
I have recently acquired both goodie boxes and am feeling a little overwhelmed with choices after looking at their rulebooks. How are you getting on with mixing various expansions to the game? I am assuming adding them all at the same time is madness(?) but perhaps the addition of a few different modules works quite well as some certainly look like they would play fine with others without adding too much complexity? Do you have particular favourite modules you will not play without?
Would love to hear your experiences with them. Thanks!

I just picked 2 at a time to try them out.

Don't use a blender.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I don't like games where there's no random setups and where players can have their own cemented strategies that they always go for in a game. I like having to adjust how you play based on board/tile setup. So I don't like Puerto Rico, for example, for this reason. It seems to me that in this game, you can decide from game to game that you're always going to go to Place A first, then Place B, etc., the only variety being how much money you pay to go to each spot.
Am I correct, or at least correct-ish?

This one is a bit different each time right out of the box and if you add any of the modules included in the base game and more in the goodies boxes, you really will likely change the openings.

You roll dice, where both the number and color matter. So you could want to always go to certain places first, but you may not have the dice. Sure you can waste moves trying to reroll or get different dice, but then your strategy isnt exactly optimal anymore.
And the market of tiles is randomized, so you arent guaranteed to always have the types of tiles you want.

In my opinion this truly a game without weakness.

I agree with RZ. Your strategy is mostly to get 1 market of each colour and getting 3- or 4-directional tiles to expand your network but tile colours and dice colours will dictate that HOW you go about doing this is different each game.

You roll dice, where both the number and color matter.

I'm watching a
2-player playthrough
, and they've now used a blue die AND a purple die to go up the river. So it seemed like colors don't matter. Do they not matter for certain actions?

Colors are critical for purchasing tiles for your board.

For most actions, only the number on the die matters. But both colour and number matter for the Building action, which is absolutely crucial to the game.
So when you choose which colours of dice to take, your choice is based on what you want to build in the near future. Because only a few buildings are available at any one time (and they vary in the colour and number of dice they require, as well as what benefits they give you) you will have to choose differently in different games.
There could be some saminess from game to game, because you might choose to focus on specific strategies. But it's the kind of game where you need to adjust your strategy depending on what is currently available and the luck of your dice rolls. Variability arises naturally!

I don't like games where there's no random setups

Randomized stuff in the setup:
* The building tiles have a randomized layout. Due to availability of market tiles this influences the attractivity of the building spot a lot in the beginning.
* You can use the Ganga module..i.e. some random spots on the river are going to be replaced with other actions..which varies things quite a bit.
* You roll your starting dice..this means the pips and available carma dictate which actions are available to you..and which are not.
* Playing with the advanced version each player gets a completely different bonus tile to place at the edge of their board. According to this you know from the beginning what bonus will be granted to you once you build a road to reach that tile. This already may steer your game in a certain direction (advancing on the river, building markets of each type, building many markets of the same type, getting many buildings...etc).
It is true that in beginning actions where you get more dice (Palace 2 and 2 dice on the river) are very valuable but in general this game has a more tactical nature. You need to react which actions are left to you and which ones you want to block. The available pips and color of own and opponent dice matter for selecting actions.

Thanks, everyone, I watched more of the playthrough and realized when the colors matter.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I just picked up a copy of the RotG base game and am debating whether to purchase the two Goodie Boxes.
More than likely, this would be purely for solo play using Mauro's very highly regarded automa.
I just wanted to see if the variant has been updated to accommodate the two Goodie boxes,
or if this would be fairly easy for someone to accomplish if he/she were so inclined (e.g. add several self-designed cards
to the automa deck to accommodate the expansions?).
I"m basically just trying to determine whether there's any point in picking up the mini-expansions
if one is likely only to play the game solo.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My wife and I played this today - really enjoyed it, but wondered if there was something similar but without the “race” aspect? Something with a set number of rounds or duration and then not knowing who would win until the end of the game and final scoring is calculated.
Thanks in advance
Jason

Quite a few games where dice are drafted and points are totted up at the end of the game. I'll mention two I have:

Pulsar 2849

and

, though I'm sure there are plenty of others.

What Ian said. And

(using the official variant for blue dice).

Take a look at


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My wife and I just played our first game.  She Killed me, not the reason for this post
What my wife did:
She built up her province with Tea spots.  Got 4 real quick.  Then was at the market every round scoring her tea.  4 spots totaled 10 coins I think it was with a die of 4.  by the end she had 5 tea spots scoring 12 gold with a die of 5.
(is that correct scoring)
What I did:
I built up my building value early.  So when I went to the tile buying area, I was scoring my one time placement of 4 with every tile. Ya poor strategy I guess.
Thanks

Yes you played it correctly. You can do even better by getting all 3 market stands and scoring 1 of each without even using a die.

Not exactly a poor strategy imo if you can combo more than one building, for a potential 8 fame boost.
Money and market sure isnt weak, but it sounds like your wife was uncontested on these spots. Don’t let her walk away with it

Read the Dutch review here!
In this boardgame version of Rajas of the Ganges, you compete with others to collect money and fame. You may just become the most influential Indian leader!

Game explanation
In Rajas of the Ganges, you are an Indian noble working to develop parts of your empire into brilliant and prosperous provinces. You make use of your dice and workers cleverly to collect fame and money.
The game takes place on the game board, which is in the middle of all players. You also have your own province board, on which you can build your province with the help of province tiles. Actions are carried out with workers on the game board. You pay for these actions with dice. It is always indicated how many of each color dice you need.
When setting up the game you place all markers at their starting positions, you can move them further using actions. At the beginning you get 1 die of each color and 3 workers, more workers can be unlocked later. For some actions you get fame or money. You must collect as much money and fame as possible to win the game. You win the game when your fame and money tracks cross each other. You can earn money and fame on many different sections of the board. The sections and what they do are explained below.
Quarry:
To get province tiles on your own board, you must go to the quarry to perform the build action. You place a worker on the lowest available space and pay the money on it. Next, you may take a province tile, provided you have enough dice of the depicted color. For example, a tile may cost 11 blue pips. The tile you buy may be placed on your province board, but there are rules for this. A province tile shows roads. These roads must always be connected to your palace (on top of the board). The province tiles show buildings or resources. When you place a tile, you immediately get fame for buildings or money for resources. The amount of fame depends on where your marker is on the building track. Expanding your province is one of the most important ways of scoring points!
Marketplace:
In the marketplace, you can place workers to sell goods. These are the goods that are on your province board. If you do not have any province tiles, you cannot sell goods.

Harbor:
A river with bonus fields runs through the game board. You can use actions in the harbor to sail your boat down the river. You immediately get the bonus of the field where your boat stops moving. So if you can move 3 spaces forward you get the bonus of that 3rd space. The bonuses you get vary from fame to performing an action in the palace.
Palace:
In the palace you can ask for help from influential people. You have to roll the dice with the exact number of pips shown on the person. Each influential person gives a different bonus, some people will give you 2 dice and others let you upgrade a building.
At the bottom of the palace, there are spaces available where you can swap a die for 2 dice of a different color or where you can simply turn in a worker for a die.
The more actions you have taken, the more fame and money you will get at some point. When the fame track and money track cross, the game ends when both players have had an equal number of turns. The player who has crossed the furthest wins the game!

Our thoughts
We are fans of Rajas of the Ganges! Both the dice game and the boardgame have earned a spot among our favorite games. Should there ever be a card game, we will definitely be at the front of the queue to buy that one too!
After playing the dice game we were so excited about Rajas that the boardgame could not be missing from our collection either. Now that we have played both games we can also compare them properly. First of all we would like to say how good the dice version of Rajas is! The dice version is really the perfect translation of the gameplay and strategic choices of the boardgame.
Rajas of the Ganges is a super strategic and exciting game. During the game you constantly feel the pressure to make the right choices and stay ahead of your opponent on the score track. This is not so easy. You can make a lot of choices and try out many different strategies. This ensures that no two games are the same. This variant is perfect if you feel like a challenging boardgame that also requires some thought. We play the dice variant more often because it is easier to set up and of course plays faster, but we love playing the board game just as much!
This is definitely a board game that we won't get bored of any time soon. In fact, you can keep the game innovative yourself by trying out different strategies and tactics. However, the game also offers an additional variant that brings even more new elements into the game. In addition, Rajas is also suitable to play with new boardgame players. In the game rules there is the tip to let the more experienced player play with the back side (variant) of his player board. This would ensure that the less experienced players have a chance to win. We think this is a very nice addition!
We are very excited about both the boardgame and the dice game of Rajas of the Ganges and would definitely recommend both games. For us, both games will definitely stay in our collection for a long time.

Playing with 2 players
As usual, you have less waiting time between turns with 2 players. This is almost always a positive thing if you like a little pace. You can also keep a better overview and keep an eye on what other players are doing. You can even try to cross other players!
Pros and cons
+ Beautiful game board
+ Extra variants
+ No game feels the same
– For some people the boardgame won't add enough compared to the dice game

Not in this game. Given the number of options on the board, the game feels too open with 2 players and really shines with the full player count for proper tension. Player poll bears this out.

While the 2-player does worse in the poll than 3, and 4 does best, it's worth pointing out that over 90% of those who voted still recommend it with 2.
The board does have a 2-player side, which makes it less open. I've only played it with 2 and have enjoyed it a lot, though obviously I can't compare how it would be with more.

Hi guys! Thanks for taking the time to read our review. We never said that the game is best with 2 players, though. We haven't gotten the chance to play with more players yet, but really liked the game at 2 players. It's a good thing they have a special side on the board for 2 players. Besides that we do like the fact that games usually take less long with 2 players. But we can definitely see how this game would do great with more players! In our case, we would definitely recommend it with 2.

Good point about the other side of the board. I had actually forgotten that. Glad to hear that works out well.

Not in this game. Given the number of options on the board, the game feels too open with 2 players and really shines with the full player count for proper tension. Player poll bears this out.

I strongly disagree. If you use the proper side of the board of course.

Hi!
I've recently bought this game (polish version by Egmont Polska) and I'm dissapointed by production quality. Even before first play, the white color from dice is peeling off, printed layer on player boards is peeling off also and purple tiles from one of the die-cut sheet were hard to pluck out and I've managed to damage some of them because of it even when I used a knife. And board is slightly warped as mentioned in different threads.
Anyone has the similar experience?

Defnitely not an issue I had.
My copy was from the first multilinual printing.

Contact the publisher about this. They should be able to replace.

My copy is just fine. Sounds like it might be a localised issue

Thank you for advice, publisher indeed made a replacement, they even sent a mini-extension in the package (Mango Village)! I was very kindly surprised.

Bought an English language copy in the UK a couple of weeks ago and I'm seeing very similar issues - with paint flaking from the dice as well as inconsistent meeple components. Have pinged an email to the publisher and we'll see how we get on!

Just to say that HUCH! sent me some replacement dice and a new set of player cubes which was appreciated! Bit ashamed to say that the flaky dice were discouraging me from getting it to the table. Looking forward to a game this evening!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now RotG is the Brands best ranked game on BGG. Village is now just number two.
It deserves it!

Congrats to RotG!
(But I still prefer Village, especially with both expansions)

Also congrats to Raja. I like it several times better than Village.

I also just realised the same thing.
And it is totally correct, I have no interest in playing Village anymore.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Complete noob here. In Advanced mode, you get a yield tile every time you visit the dancer. If you visit the Dancer multiple times, do you just swap a previously-laid yield tile on your province board with the new one?

You put the tile on an
unoccupied
spot of the same color as the tile.

Ah, thank you! That sounds much better. I am getting ready for my first game with my partner, so I am trying to cover some of the question s that may pop up.

Hi, just started playing this with the Mautoma deck of cards and for the life in me I cannot understand what the card with the four dice represents! Which action does it refer to?
Thanks.
Martin

First, thanks for your question--it pointed me to the Mautoma deck, which I had never heard of! I assume those four dice represent the "balconies action":
Balconies action: look the blue side of the first automa card that is remained on the top of the automa deck and place the Automa's worker on the balcony space shown on the card.

Ah, you're welcome, it's brilliant too. Just got a sound thrashing even on easy though I don't know the game very well at all. You are right also, it is the balconies action. I've used a Mautoma deck before for Heaven and Ale and it was excellent. This one is better in my opinion however.
Cheers

Hi
One river tile in this modul tell "take one of your already-placed workers off the gameboard and immediatly, without paying the placement cost, place him on an unoccupied space of your choice"
Could you tell me if I can perform the action of the place where I place my worker, or it's just to block a space to avoid other players to do this action
Thanks

Yes, you do the action. The whole point is to give you an extra action.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi
In the base game, if we play with the river tiles extension, there are 3 tiles with the following bonus "Take the palace action, depending on the character shown (see page 18, The “Chambers“).
I think I don't have to use a worker to do this action on the palace, but I would like to know if I have to use a dice corresponding to the character, or if it's free
Thanks

The rules for the river spaces printed on the board that allow you to use the palace action say:

Choose any of the palace actions 2 - 6 (Dancer, Yogi, Raja, Master builder or Portuguese) and carry it out immediately
without placing a worker in the palace or giving up a die
(the space in the palace may even be occupied).

(Emphasis mine)
I'm sure these river spaces are meant to work in the same way, it's just that you have to use a specific character rather than getting a choice.

The English rules answer this quite clearly, I think:

Choose any of the palace actions 2 - 6 (Dancer, Yogi, Raja, Master builder or Portuguese) and carry it out immediately
without placing a worker in the palace or giving up a die
(the space in the palace may even be occupied).

(Emphasis mine)

I believe the question is regarding the Ganga Module that has tiles that specify a single character in the palace to replicate. The rules aren’t as clear as they don’t mention the no worker, no die clause. I have interpreted these as similar to the rule that Mark is quoting, but it limits you to the character shown. In most cases, you’ve already given up a worker and a die to take the action that triggered your boat moving onto that river space. Paying again would make it less of a bonus.

I believe the question is regarding the Ganga Module that has tiles that specify a single character in the palace to replicate.

Yes, I realised that just after I posted, and edited my post!

Hi
One of the brown tile give bonus "2 money for each yield tile you have connected"
I would like to know if I win 2 money if I connect a place where there is a bonus, but not a bonus tile, only the bonus printed on the individual board
Thanks
Philippe

Hi Philippe,
Since it says "yield tile", I think only actual tiles count, not spaces with no tile on them. Otherwise I don't think it would use the word "tile".

Raja of the Ganges is criminally underplayed in my collection. I bought it ages back, played it ONCE, and never brought it back out. The game was fun enough, and warranted further exploration, but things just didn't roll in its favor.
Fast forward to today, and I've decided to remedy that by ordering both Goodie Boxes (well, 1 and 2 - are there more?). I can find lists of what is included in said boxes, but beyond the Mango expansion (which I already own) I'm not really sure what these items are.
So, in lieu of digging through a bunch of listings and teasing it out, I wanted to ask:
in terms of augmenting the core play, or adding a spin on the core experience, which items did you find the most exciting or novel?

We have both Goodie boxes and only recently added a few of the items.
I probably most enjoy all the the tiles that modify the river spots and it is very easy to incorporate.
We use all the new animal tiles which are a good novelty and don't seem to affect the game too much, (though the colour on the tile back don't come near to matching).
We also enjoy the Gem Traders Meeples as a nice little bonus.
We've used the Pink Elephant once and it seemed to be ok.
The thing with most if not all of these mini expansions, they make the game easier so, in my mind, are best used when the game gets just a little stale, (though this is great design). Saying that we will likely continue to use all of the above and a try a few others in coming plays.

By Far, the Mango Grove is the best IMO. Pretty much everything else Frank S mentioned above, I agree with wholeheartedly.

Id have to totally agree, the mango farm removes some of teh pain of low rolls when trying to build

Are these goodie boxes available on retail where you live? I live in Canada, and I have not been able to find them anywhere.

Thanks! The second goodie box is available at FLGS, but the first one is only available via Amazon for double the regular price.

but beyond the Mango expansion (which I already own) I'm not really sure what these items are.

Note that the goodie box has two new mango villages compared to the original release of the expansion if I'm not mistaken (and also compared to yucata). So be careful when trading your perceived duplicate away.
I've not managed to test all of the new items yet. I also think, mango village is great and all the new animal tiles for building are. There are nice elements here like permanent gains or tiles that bring workers already used that round back (with all the implications the newly freed action place has)
Overall mango villages and other things like river expansion give you more opportunities to get dice which makes the game faster/easier as others said and is desirable to some extend. But it also means that terrible spots like balkony/terraces will get used even less if at all and the pink elephant probably won't change this much.
They also weakened the diversified market spot as you don't need dice to activate your mango villages later and they are usually stronger than the market spot and highly compete for early building. In addition there are new river tiles like "2 upgrades" and "Score a province tile again" which shift focus towards fame/points track (with Gem Traders Meeples adding to this). Imagine scoring a fully upgraded double building tile for 8 points again and maybe a third time via dolphin. While you can boost markets with some new tiles as well it will be difficult to score a corresponding 16 coin effect. This is overall also somewhat desirable, but makes markets imho almost a bit too weak (depends on the river though).
I also like the new karma temple - it's very easy to implement.
Right now I think pure basegame is a pain to play for me. I accidently accepted one at yucata - so I know what I'm talking about. If starting player gets a 2 dice and can start with dancer you are at a clear disadvantage at two player game in second position already. And overall so much dependend on the roll of the dice.
I'm also not a big fan of Navaratnas whereas others say this is the true game (I think starting brown tiles are unbalanced to begin with and somehow don't like the flow of the game with Navaratnas).
But Rajas with mango villages, variable river and other goodies is a great great game - for me especially with two players when there is not that much fluctuation at quarry and river between your turns and you can plan better overall.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have read some threads that consider the markets to be overpowered, or at least, some people consider that markets are too strong and make less attractive to explore other strategies (aka fame).
Also, to me, it was kind of awkward that buildings only score when placed and there is not way to trigger them in the future but markets score both when you buy the tile and every time when triggered.
I read some possible tweaks to weaken the markets with some house rules (paying coins for market spot,...), but I wonder if it would not be easier to take a more 'intuitive' approach:
-Buildings score when you place the tiles. As per rules.
-Markets do not score when you buy the tile, only when triggered by going to the market sites in future turns.
I don't know how to explain it, but I am used to see this mechanism in games: something gives you points only when you buy it, while something else gives you points later many times but not when you buy it. To me, it just sounds rounded when you put both together like that.
Anyway,  it is just a very fine tuning to the markets income, just enough to bring the markets strategy a notch down and provide an incentive to use other strategies available.

Nice and clean. I will try it as I also feel like market's are too essential.

Personally I enjoy Rajas because it is a game of balance, efficiency and maneuvering around other players, all the while having to pivot depending on what dice you roll.
So I dont see money as a "strategy-path" that is too powerful to ignore and then get frustrated by the game being unbalanced.
I see it as a integral part of building your engine in the game. And the struggle over the tiles and the spot to activate the markets are important to the flow of the game. It makes it so if you arent going first, you have a chance at other high value spots if the first two players pick the money spot. Or if you are going first, you may have the tough decision to forgo the money spot because it is too critical to get a different action. Or maybe you forgo it because you think the other players also have high priority actions they must take so the spot will probably come back around to you.
Generally I find euro games with interesting balancing decisions more replayable. One that just leverages "many paths to victory" gives you replayability as long as you try each path. But after youve tried each of them, they lose their luster, and you are left with a game that needs interesting decisions outside of just variety.

If you find the markets to be overpowered, the Mango Village expansion provides a nice alternative path to constantly vying for the market payoff spots. It's available as part of Goodie Box 1. I only had a couple markets in my last game, and went heavy fame for a solid win.

Wait a second.... Market tiles trigger when placed!?? I've been playing this wrong!!

Or, you've been play testing this variant already.
Is it any good?

It is! I'll have to pay it "correctly" and suss out the difference.

well, there you go!
You should let us know which one feels better. I have not tried it myself yet!

Finally played the game using the proper "Market tiles trigger when placed" rule.  Result?
NO DIFFERENCE in game play.
Since the rule as played benefits/punishes everyone equally, and the tiles are flush with markets in the 12 stacks, everyone can take advantage of this at their discretion.
The only difference is PLAY TIME.  The game with the rule is about two rounds shorter, as there is obviously more money earned, hasting the playtime.  This worked out to about a 20 minutes shorter game.
In summary, there is no benefit in NOT playing as the rules stated, and i would recommend playing as the manual suggests.

That's what I would expect. But the fact the game is prolonged a round or two means that going for markets is a little less appealing, and conversely, buildings may then feel a little stronger as that strategy has a round or two to breath. So I will still play around with this variant because in a race game, it's hard to ignore a strategy that produces faster than the other.

well, if every player is doing markets equally the variant will not make any difference, as CMcGee has found out.
It is supposed to make a difference for the player who decides to go a different way. I thought it was obvious.

We just played our first game of Rajas last night and as I misread the rules we ended up playing with your suggested variant: structures scoring fame immediately while markets have to be triggered. Even with three new players we didn't notice this being a pain point or impacting our ability to take effective turns. I would rule this a viable variant if it's your preference to slow the game a bit.
Gonna play with the actual rules tonight.

I can understand why you want to reduce the power of the market. Although the market may seemed overpowered (score once one place and score again when sell), each money is equivalent to two fame scores. If you reduced the benefits of market, I suspect many of your games may be lopsided to become fame track heavy. Hope it makes sense


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the first play-through, i was referencing the manual quite a bit.  I found myself needlessly flipping through page after page to visually find what i was looking for.  Inevitably i'd find it, but it would be either in German or French, because all three sections are identical (with the exception of the text, of course).
But there's a solution!  If you, like me, cannot read German nor French, and have absolutely NO NEED for them, you can quite easily MODIFY the manual to separate the English only section.  I don't know if the designers did this on purpose, but it works out perfectly.
Here's how:
- Carefully un-bend the two paperclips of the manual.
- Remove pages 13-24 (the English section) from the middle of the manual
- Remove the staples from the outside of the manual
- Re-insert the staples back into the existing holes of the English-only pages
- Close the staples
And wallah!  You've got an English-only manual!



Voila!

Dort!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm new to this game and enjoying it so far, and most everything is straightforward. I just want to clarify myself on the bonuses on the money track. I understand that to start the game, every player has that circle token that when crossed, you get that bonus (e.g. river space 1 movement), and then it flips and goes to space 22. Once 22 is crossed, you get the two dice and the token is flipped again to space 44, and so on. That makes sense.
So, the circle token on the money track functions as a sort of tracker that I got that bonus already. Thus and this is my question, if I fall below that space (from spending money for an action) and then I move past it again, I don't get that bonus again, correct?
I only ask because the bonus is pre-printed directly on the money track itself, and it threw me off and implied that I could get the bonus again (which I don't think is the case). I think the pre-printed bonus is just there to point out where the bonus token would be to start. If that's the case, it would've been nice if it was printed grayed out or faded (like the worker bonuses on the money track).

Hello, you are absolutely right. The preprinted bonus is there only to point out where to put the marker. As you will spend and earn money continuously, it is to avoid getting the same bonus over and over again... enjoy the game!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello everyone,
I have not tried either of these games, and from watching the videos, I'm very attracted to both.
Both games appear to have some similarities.
Given limited shelf space, which one would you recommend I buy?
Many thanks.

I love both games, but for different reasons.
Rajas is your typical worker placement game, but with an added element of using dice as a resource, with their numbers being important as to what you can do.  The unique mechanism of this game is making the money track and the fame track meet, and working those separate engines at the same time.
Coimbra is more of a dice drafting game, but also has the added puzzle of both the color and the number of the dice being important.  You'll use those dice to recruit nobles (cards) which can progress you up 4 different tracks.  So there's an engine that you're sort of building here too, but it's very different from Rajas.
I would probably lean Rajas, as I like that one slightly more.  However, Rajas is available to play online on Yucata.de.  Coimbra may only be available on Tabletop Simulator or Tabletopia.  Either way, you can't go wrong.

Both games are keepers for me. I see little to no similarity between them.

Thanks for for your insights everyone. It definitely looks like both games are good, and I should get both at some point. Based on comments here and on the Coimbra forum, I'll probably get Coimbra first.
It's so hard to make space...tough decisions definitely need to be made on what to let go.

I have been tempted for some good Coimbra offers in my area... but I have not jumped yet. It seems to me that the game can be decided in just that card towards the end that either you get or you don't... also it has to be very frustrating if another player grabs that card that you planned to get. It also seems too much of points bonanza for everything.
This is only my own personal opinion, because I prefer games where you have some focus point. But if you convince me, I may buy it and try it. I really love the colorful components for sure.
I am playing Rajas on yucata, because I like the Indian theme, but I am not sure if the pure working placement mechanism is for me. I prefer games where you build something or go somewhere. The personal tableau of your city  where you build the tiles you acquire is a nice component of the game which Coimbra does not have. At least you feel you build something.

Thanks for the comment Fernando.

I was very excited when Rajas came out. I love Inka and Marcus Brands games.
But maybe I am a little dissapointed about this game. Most important thing is that I get a feeling that Rajas is a race game. And I don't like this. When someone get to the point when he's earning a lot of money and can transform money into point big time, he will win. Nobody can stop him. Markets are everything. And it can happen quite early in the game.
I haven't play Coimbra yet.

Thanks Gasper


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For those who play with any of the expansions, which ones do you use and how often? Do you have a system to decide? I am asking because I have the first Goodies box and the second is on the way so I will have a lot of choices. Thanks for any advice.

I play with everything in Goodies box 1, except the faith tiles, I find them clunky.
Everything else is superb and spices the base game in numerous ways.

Always play with the mango grove (as it makes low rolls more valuable) andalways play with the modified river (variant from the base game).
I've not felt I needed more variability than that tbh so not picked up the oterh expansion.

From Goodie Box 1 you may include everything except Test of Faith module. It is indeed clunky. I also personally don't like Gem Traders and don't include them as well.
From Goodie Box 2 you definitely want to include Cow Tiles, new river tokes and Blessings of Kedarnath, which adds new action space. Also pink elephant makes the rightmost space on the balcony (gallery, if I'm not mistaken) more attractive (I've played a lot of games and never saw anybody using this space). The rest is quite questionable.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How do the blank white yield spots work?
I assume I get to pick the special yield of my color choice? Or, do I take a white yield token?

You take white. You always take a matching color on the advanced board.

A white of your choice.

Just to make sure we're all on the same page here: if you connect to that yield space
without
having put a tile on it, you get nothing (because nothing is printed there).
As it's a white space, you can put a white yield tile on it when you gain one. If you connect to it
after
that, you get what's printed on that tile. Again, that's the same as all the other yield spaces - the difference here is just that if there's no tile on it there's no reward.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The poll voting is not very strong - around 9% with an unofficial variant.  So is this a good solo choice? Does it have repeatability? Help - any pro/con advice is grand. Or are there better choices? I am contemplating this or First Class: All aboard the Orient Express or even Architects of the West Kingdom and trying to decide where to invest.
I prefer a solo game I setup on the floor while my family watches TV and completes within an hour. Something light to medium with good choices/neat puzzle and preferably a win/loss. So Wingspan, Everdell, Oh My Goods, Maquis are some examples. If I have freetime to do a table layout I like Blackout HongKong or started dabbling in Arkham. Enjoyed Carcassone and It's a Wonderful World solo for a bit, but they got stale with the high score only.
Appreciated - Tim

I think it's ok with the Automa-variant, but I mostly prefer playing other games like Terraforming Mars, Pandemic (not only the base game, but also extensions and spinoffs), Flash Point, Space Alert, Viticulture, Hornet Leader instead of it.

No, it's not a good solo choice. Not at all.

When money and fame counters  meets or pass each other, last round is on. Depending on which player counters meets, all remaining players in player order place ONE meeple on board, to all players plays equal number of turns. If at the end of this last round there is only one player with intercepted counters - he/she is the winner. IF more players counters intercepts, count differnce of Fame points between fame and money counters. Player with most difference points win, if tied, player who intercepts first, is the winner.
So in conclusion...  if your counters do not intercept, you can not win, does not matter how far one of your counters is on track.
Also does not matter on which NUMBER of fame or money track you intercept. Only matters if you was the 1st and only, or if there are more intercepted players, whose DIFFERENCE between counters is bigger.

That's correct. It looks like the OP is thinking of fame points as victory points. They aren't. There really aren't VPs in the game, though I guess you could think of the distance between your markers as negative VPs (unless yours have passed, then it's positive).

I guess you could think of the distance between your markers as negative VPs (unless yours have passed, then it's positive).

Interesting thought. I will use it in the next explanation of the rules.

I think he is also thinking of the interception as merely the trigger for the end game, and not the winning condition in itself, which it is.  The actual values of the fame and money don’t matter at all, only whether they cross over and by how much.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the Navaratnas bend yield, it says 2 fame for each bend built in your province.  Do you count tiles that have been built over by the Master Builder?  We assumed no, but couldn’t find any rules on it.

I would agree with you. Only visible tiles should be eligible.

The whole idea behind Master Builder is to change the layout of the province. Covered tiles don't exist as far as the province is concerned, so counting them doesn't really make sense.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I recently ran some statistics on games from 2017 only and Rajas of the Ganges was one of the front runners. It ranked 4th in 3 categories: Best Strategic Medium-Heavy game of the year, Game that plays best with 4p, and game that can be best played with 10 year olds and up. It is also one of the 2017 games that has still been constantly climbing in the charts over the past 12 months.
Here is the full view on 2017 for anyone interested:
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2429051/article/34836057
Btw, I do not own RotG yet, but will be picking it up ASAP from my FLGS. I am really intrigued by it and I can’t wait to get it to the table

I like it. It initially appears very busy. and the initial rules teach can take quite a while. However people seem to pick it up very quickly, as they get a feel for the dual scoring tracks. Worker placement and dice usage are usually familiar concepts, as is the Carcassonne-like tile laying.
Criticisms?
Not many.
- There isn't a catch-up mechanism and coupled with the steadily rising scores per round, can lead to a runaway winner.
- The colours on the tiles are sometimes a little hard to tell apart (IIRC the blue and the green) and this from someone who isn't colour-blind. It would also have been better to have the tiles on the board (and hence in easy reach/sight of all), but not possible on such a busy board.
I'm glad I have it and hope you enjoy it as much

My sentiments exactly. I have introduced Rajas of the Ganges to several friends and all of them have thoroughly enjoyed this board game from Inka & Markus Brand.

I definitely think this game has gone under the radar a bit. Its graphic design is pretty "busy" and has a lot of rules.
But I think the actual game play is absolutely fantastic. Its not the heaviest game ever, but it has a lot of fun interaction. Pretty much the core of the game is worker placement, but with the twist of being able to account for what colors and pips of dice you and your opponents have. It creates a thinky puzzle, but not too paralyzing, since your dice do limit your options to a certain extent.
Lastly, once you have playing it a couple times, you can get through the game in around 45mins, which is great for a midweight euro.

You kind of name the points why I didn't try it yet.
The board is small and busy. If it was bigger it would help a lot (bit it wouldn't help the price of the game).
The fact that after a while the winner is already kind of known is something i absolutely don't like in a euro.
And the colors a little bit. I have the feeling that the number on the dice is more i portant than the color and I feel when you have so many dices in different colors that it should be the other way around...
That's all an opinion without even playing the game though.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

with a 1-pip, you get to move 1 on the river, with a 2-pip, you get to move 1-2 spaces and with 3-pips, you get to move 1-3 on the river.
With the "portguese" option of a 6-pip dice box, we were thinking we could say it should be 1-6 moves, not the exact 6 as written in the rules.
anyone else felt the 6-pip box is under-used or if used, the players loses out on all other bonuses?

I think it's important to only move the exact 6 and take that bonus. There are other benifits to moving six spaces at once, such as retrieving your extra worker and reaching the high scoring potential river spaces near the end quickly.

MAking it 1-6 would make it over-powered.
when buying locations for your tableau, a 6 is already much mroe usefful than a 12, or 3, so to also make a 6 capable of being the best movement dice also would unbalance everything in my view.

I use it very often actually. As Craig mentioned, it helps you get an extra worker. Also, in average I don't use the caravelas as often as that, so if I can advance 6 in one go that's perfect. Often I wait for other players to move ahead of me so I get to move even 7-9 spaces instead. It's a great power and I never thought it needed changing. If you plan it right it's an excellent power.

the '6' spot as it is is already very powerful. Getting up the river takes a lot of movement. '6' make it manageable (still not easy without using the '6' spot once or twice at least).
In addition to the 6th worker, the rewards at the end of the river are very powerful also - scoring 3 diff markets, 5 of a single market, 2 fame x 3 karma = 6 fame, etc.

Thanks for all replies. Maybe I am playing it wrong, or maybe it maybe that it is not useful for the basic variant. I will try the variant that requires getting all 3 workers, not just 2 of the 3.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The way I understand the rules, you don't.  However, this strikes me as a little strange.  In some cases, particularly the red tiles, I don't know why you'd ever want to take a yield tile?  A dice selection is almost always better than a river movement or a bit of money when you don't know when you'll be able to connect that yield tile (i.e. it takes minimum two actions to get the tile then to connect it, which is a big risk).  I am excited to try the Navaratnas variant, and think the dancer being OP is one of the only weaknesses in the basic variant.
I feel like it should be possible to upgrade, rather than replace, the province bonus yields.  Am I right that according to the rules this is not the case, and you do have to replace it with the yield tile you select?

My interpretation of the rules is that the tiles replace whatever is printed on the board. This is how we've always played it. All yield tiles are slightly better than their printed versions, but not crazy better. I think that's fine, as you said the dancer would still be crazy op otherwise (it continues to be pretty much the best spot even with Navaratnas)

You don't take the minor (covered) bonus, of course. And yield tiles are always better than printed ones. I would always take free river movement over the printed die. You just need to do it in the right moment, that's all.

So when we play with this variant,
if the preprinted yield is not covered and I establish a connection do I get the preprinted benefit or nothing?
Can I put a special yield after the connection is done?
thanks

Yes, you get the printed bonus; that's why it's there. You could still put down a yield tile after the connection is made if you wish, but you won't get the tile's bonus. There's a reason you might want to do that anyway, if you're wondering. One of the yield tiles scores points for each yield tile connected to your realm; adding a tile to an existing connection would increase the bonus when you finally make the connection to the tile-counting bonus tile.

So when we play with this variant,
if the preprinted yield is not covered and I establish a connection do I get the preprinted benefit or nothing?
Can I put a special yield after the connection is done?
thanks

You get the preprinted benefit - unless the preprinted benefit
is
nothing, of course!
I don’t think the rules forbid you from putting a yield tile afterwards, but you would gain no benefit from it because you only gain the benefit when you first place a tile that connects to it. After you’ve done that it’s too late.
Edit:

Eric and Mark, thank you for answering the question I was about to ask!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Got the game last week.......it is not a problem for me but my orange dice were yellow just letting others know it happened in case it happened to them.
I liked my first game we played and looking forward to 4 player run.
Thanks

Like I said it’s not an issue..... I am putting a photo up but have to wait till it’s approved.... not sure how to add thee photo here but tomorrow or later today I’ll link it.
It’s as yellow as yellow can be

Just FYI, you don't need to have an image approved to put into a post. Instead, just upload to your personal gallery.
In the new editor, use the Embed Media -> Image option

In the legacy editor, use the Upload New Geek Image option

Ahhhh... thanks didn’t realize I could do that.

Recently purchased the game as well and mine also came with bright Yellow dice instead of the Orange dice that is clearly printed on all the artwork. I contacted R&R games customer service and after about 5 days they responded and informed me that "there are two versions of this game" and I had bought the one with Yellow dice.
They then said for $6 plus shipping they would send me the Orange dice which is clearly printed on all the artwork, gameboard and rulebook so that my copy would be fixed.
I declined and respectfully let them know my frustration at their complete lack of owning up to such an obvious production mistake and then to charge the customer to fix it. We all know games are a luxury but with this, it's purely the principle of the matter.
I hope this helps someone else out there that may have ended up buying the same faulty "version" that I did.

I declined and respectfully let them know my frustration at their complete lack of owning up to such an obvious production mistake and then to charge the customer to fix it. We all know games are a luxury but with this, it's purely the principle of the matter.

I'm sorry that having yellow dice instead of orange makes the game unplayable for you. At least that's what I assumed, deriving from your points about "principle of the matter".

Here's the rub: if it's discovered that promised goods are not provided upon purchasing a product marketed with specific goods included it's deceptive marketing and failure to provide the promised goods, which were purchased in good faith, is poor customer relations. Are the colour of the dice a big deal and does it change the game play? Not at all. But as the colour orange is one of my favourite colours I might choose this game over another knowing that this one comes with orange dice (yes, I'm petty sometimes). Finding that those dice were actually yellow would be a disappointment, betrayal of the good faith transaction between buyer and seller, and failure to provide the promised content.
In this way it IS the principle of the issue and the company should be willing to correct this mistake at their own expense as the buyer has already PAID for the promised product, even if the seller has to request the return of the yellow dice. Imagine if you bought a red sports car based on images online (you'd be an idiot but stay with me for a moment) however, when you came to pick it up the car was pink. The colour of the car doesn't in any way affect the ability to drive the car or it's performance, and the shade is even CLOSE to the promised colour! Would you be comfortable with this transaction or would you feel lied to because it's not the agreed upon product for which you paid?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rajas of the Ganges was published in 2017. It is a dice activation game with tile laying on individual tableau boards. It’s for two to four players. The designers are Inka and Markus Brand. The game takes just over an hour to play.
Components
The components are of great quality. It features wooden workers, ships and score trackers. There are also wooden cubes to keep a track of your Karma and building upgrades. There is a double sided province board and lots of tiles. There is a Kali statute to hold your dice and of course, 48 brightly coloured translucent dice in four colours. There is a cute cardboard elephant first player marker and double sided folding game board.  The game comes with a functional plastic insert and in a Ticket to Ride sized box with enough room for promos. The instruction booklet is well laid out and is easy to understand with plenty of pictures.

Set Up
Each player chooses their colour and takes four dice (one in each colour) which you place in your Kali statute and a province board. You start with three workers but it’s possible to get another two by progressing up the score tracks or Ganges. You place your boat at the beginning of the Ganges river and cubes on the four building types and your Karma score.
Overall the board looks really daunting to new players. There are loads of action spaces and it’s difficult for new players to work out what to do. However, they soon pick it up. I love that they made both the board, the Kali statutes and player mats double sided for extra variability.
The games comes with two built in expansions; the Navaratnas version and the Ganga module. Both of these add variability as well.

The Artwork and theme
The artwork is stunning and always draws complimentary comments. It’s really bright and vibrant. The drawings of the buildings are detailed and beautifully executed. The graphic design carries over to the player boards and tiles.
There is scaling for two player on one side of the board and 3 to 4 on the other with tokens you can block of action spaces for three players.

Game play
The game has a two scoretracks, fame and wealth. Each fame space is worth two wealth. The game ends when a players fame and wealth tracks meet. There  are bonuses you can achieve on the tracks which add to your decision as to which actions to take. It’s vitally important that you try and get an additional worker as soon as possible.
The province boards have lot of bonus opportunities if you can connect the roads back to your palace.  bonuses provide dice, upgrades and wealth. Tiles have roads, buildings and tea, silk and spice markets. Flexible tiles with four way intersections tend to be more expensive as do tiles with multiple buildings or markets.

Markets have an engine building quality in that there are action spaces that allow you to score them again. Markets generate wealth and with three different market you can score 5 to 8 wealth. You can upgrade the fame you score for each of the building types so that you score 3 or 4 fame instead of two fame. So buildings also have an engine building element to them, although you need to select your tiles carefully to get the right buildings.
There are action spaces which allow you to get Karma, dice, first player and fame, upgrades and wealth. The master builder allow you to overbuild tiles, only paying the additional dice cost. Finally there is a space which allows you to advance up the river exactly six spaces. This is great as the bonus spaces on the river get more powerful towards the end if the river but obviously you will be foregoing skipped bonuses as well.
A common problem with dice activation games is how lucky you are with rolling your dice. In this game there is a dice mitigation mechanism using you Karma score to flip your dice. But as many action spaces just require a particular colour of dice or no dice at all and the river requires low dice (1 to 3) you still have options whatever you roll.

There is some criticism that some spaces, like the Dancer (two dice and a bonus) are too powerful. But I think whilst it does seem quite unbalanced you still have options and can take first player to utilise the dancer next turn. There are bonus spaces on the river which allow you to use this space and the other spaces even if they are occupied.
The space which allows you to activate three different markets (without using a worker) is really powerful. But again there are options. You can take first player to use it next round or there is an  option on the river.  I’ve seen players win using a fame strategy or combination of both.
Players who ignore the Ganges time track do so at their peril. There are opportunities to use your Karma score to get dice as well as score markets, get fame, upgrades and wealth, not to mention an additional worker.
Overbuilding shouldn’t be ignored either especially if you are pursuing a fame strategy. Whilst you can’t score bonuses again you can overbuild to change direction or buy expensive multi building tiles.
Expansions
There are a wealth of promos available for this game. Mango Village has extra tiles which enable you to get bonus (dice, upgrades, wealth, karma and river movement) and has action spaces which enables you to score two mango village tile again. These do not require a worker and so help counter the powerful market scoring action space.
The snake promo features Shalimar gardens which have a four way intersection and enable you to have an extra worker in that round. The tiger promo features four tiles with a three way intersection which give players a permanent gain that allows more flexibility with karma, river actions, action spaces and dice.

Scoring
End game scoring is pretty straight forward. You just complete the current stage and then check who has won.
Finally.....
I think this will really appeal if you like

or

. It’s a nice game, not too long with lovely art and components. The gameplay is smooth with some nice decision making.

Really good review and nicely illustrated as well.
I must say you play fast though! With 4 players we seem to go for more than twice that length of time (though there is the rules explanation). Is the just over an hour for 2P and experienced players?

4 Players takes in our group 90 minutes at the max. 2 players is below 1 hour.

Nice review. Since you mentioned the promos it would have been helpful to also mention that most are bumbled together in the Goodies box.

nice review, Caroline. I made a review for this a long time ago, but my English is not as good as yours
. At full count doesn't take us more than 1 h 30 min to play. You will get more and more familiar with the action spaces and the flow of the game will only get faster. At 2 we play this easily in less than 40 min. It's a really fun, worker-placement race. The princess spot is definitely abused. It is one of the best dice returns, and playing in advanced mode helps a little (so bonuses are not scored right away but have to be placed on your player grid).  Maybe Caroline doesn't have the goodies box so she might have gotten the promos separately. You can get all the promos that are out with the goodies box (except 2 I think).

A common problem with dice activation games is how lucky you are with rolling your dice. In this game there is a dice mitigation mechanism using you Karma score to flip your dice. But as many action spaces just require a particular colour of dice or no dice at all and the river requires low dice (1 to 3) you still have options whatever you roll.

I think this is one of the best parts of the game. The fact that the colors matter and you have mechanisms to choose which color. And the dice values matter, but different values are useful for other things. Both of those elements lead to gameplay where 1) you have to think tactically in certain cases instead of entirely calculating out super far and 2) you can use familiarity with the game to judge other player's dice and where they would like to go so you can avoid those spots in your plan, or try to get there before them.

There is some criticism that some spaces, like the Dancer (two dice and a bonus) are too powerful. But I think whilst it does seem quite unbalanced you still have options and can take first player to utilise the dancer next turn.

While these spots are slightly higher demand, I dont have a big issue with this in a worker placement. Having high contention spots makes it more important to go first so taking first player or at least being mindful of it becomes part of the gameplay. Additionally at certain parts in the game, knowing when something like the Dancer is less important compared to rushing for a different spot for your strategy creates an interesting dynamic.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello
So Ive only played the game 4 times, but always with the Narvaratnas set-up.  I particularly enjoy the yield tiles and the options they provide.
However, Im actually considering sticking to the basic version regarding that 6th worker (whilst keeping the rest of the advanced version rules).  Reason being, I like the idea that you can choose 2 of the 3 paths to obtain your extra workers (fame, money, river) and not need to worry about the 3rd option, whereas in the Narvaratnas version I find you need to go for all 3, eventually, and only once you've obtained all 6 workers can you freely focus on leaning on fame, money or the river.  But by this point you are maybe 2 rounds from finishing the game.  So my early experience has been that that 6th worker takes away the flexibility of going all-in on fame or money, which is the crux of the scoring mechanism.
I really like the bonus yield tile for those with less workers (I find getting extra workers often too powerful in many worker placement games), but it still feels like a short term compensation... its a great mechanism, but strategically, you eventually need to get to 6 to compete.
Im sure those of you with more experience can disagree, so thats why I bring up the topic to get some insight on your thoughts.  Do you find in the basic game (max. 5 workers), people typically just ignore the river track because it isn't an end game element?  Thats about the only reason I can imagine it to be preferred.
thanks,

Ur house rule seems reasonable it's like an in between basic and advanced and not a big house rule. If players are really good, they wouldn't ignore River because the end of the river is really powerful and river is a good use of your low value dice.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maybe I’m just tired, but I have no idea what this means: what is the fifth stage, and why would one player have more workers if we all start with all 6 workers?

You only start with 4 workers and you get an additional worker when reaching one of the corresponding fields. So players may have different numbers of workers to use.
As each player only uses one worker when it is his turn, it happens that one player has a fifth turn and another player does not (as all of his available workers are already used). He then gets that bonus.

Ok. Would it be fair to say if I start the game with all six workers according to the variant then I would not have to worry about this rule?

Ok. Would it be fair to say if I start the game with all six workers according to the variant then I would not have to worry about this rule?

As I pointed out, you don't start with six, so the question is moot.

Maybe I’m just tired, but I have no idea what this means: what is the fifth stage, and why would one player have more workers if we all start with all 6 workers?

Stage is the term the rules use to refer to one time around the table, with each player getting a chance to place a worker or claim a tile. It's defined at the beginning of the Course of the Game section of the rules. You don't
start
with six workers in the variant; you start with three and have the opportunity to gain three more. The difference between this and the ordinary rules is that the ordinary rules allow you to gain only two more workers.

Ahhh- that clears it up for me thank you so much for taking the time!

is it worthless to grab the starting player? we played twice now, noone ever ever never ever never ever never ever ever took the starting player.
why you ask? because it gets passed clockwise after the round too, so your are last in the next round, the worst spot to be in and it doesnt get better fast.
so why should i ever ever.... ever take this???
maybe in the last round, but anytime else, noooope.
the starting player marker (this elephant rider dude) should be passed COUNTERCLOCKWISE! then it would make sense to grap it, since you are second place then in the next round and so on.
Or did i read the rules wrong?

You misread. The starting player marker passes clockwise
only if no one takes it
. From the rules:

If nobody has sent a worker to the Great Mogul, the elephant goes from the previous starting player clockwise to the next player.

I disagree with you. I recommend you play a few more times before you start suggesting that the game needs fixing.
In my experience I didn't use that person at all in the first few games. Now, I find it is a fundamental power that can be game changing. It's all about timing and current tiles on display.
This is specially powerful if you were faster getting an extra worker than everybody else.
Keep playing, you'll find you want to be first player at certain times so other players don't take away a certain spot in the market or build that tile you really want.

You’ve definitely misread the rules. It makes no sense to get it only to pass it at the end of the round. Is that what you were doing?
It’s a crucial part of our games.

If you need money, you'd like to go to the spaces that score 3 different markets. Unfortunately, other players like to go there, too. So I always appreciate to be first or second, so sometimes it's worth actively becoming the starting player, sometimes it's not. It depends.
And yes - The round after you're starting player, you go last - except you select it again (or your right neighbour does).

is it worthless to grab the starting player?

Not at all.  Especially if there's competition for any action spots.  If multiple people have markets on their player board, then getting to place in one of the few spots that allows you to get money from markets can be huge.  If you get to do it, but the guy before you in turn order doesn't, it can literally swing the score by 18 coins.  On top of that it's just 2 fame flat out.

why you ask? because it gets passed clockwise after the round too, so your are last in the next round, the worst spot to be in and it doesnt get better fast.

No... if you take the start marker then it doesn't rotate but rather goes to whoever took it.
I really don't understand why you thought it would still rotate.  That would make no sense.  That should have been an obvious "Wait... why would they do it this way?!?!" moment that made you realize something was wrong.

Early game I see it taken most frequently to guarantee players utilising the chamber they want, later in the game it's more likely to be to guarantee access to the market space they want. I don't think I've used that space myself, but it's got regular use, more so than the 5 pip and 6 pip slots

I’ve literally never seen anyone use the five pip spot.

You should try it sometime. It works really well later in the game when you can just slam tiles with fame buildings on top of other tiles. Lets you easily place some of those 7+ pip tiles with 2 fame buildings without having to have all the same color dice.

I guess.... but you have to have a 5 die and then a die for the difference between the two tiles, right?  Assuming you have dice of the same color it’s usually better to spend two dice to just place a new tile as it helps you reach more bonus spaces along the edge of the board.

Just wanted to say that "never ever" once will suffice.

ah ok i did not misread it but i did not make my statement clear, wops.
Yes you are first next round, but then you are last the round after that! that was the big debuff you get.
so 4 player game, if im last atm and i dont take starting player, im 3rd next round, then 2nd, then 1st.
if i take it, im 1st next round and then again fking last the round after, so i loose 1 action to be first next round and then be last again?? whoot
and this is the only scenario i would take starting player, if im 3rd, why should i take it? to be first next round and then be last again the round after? lol noo. better i wait, i will be second next round and then first again.
so i would only take it if im last player, and even then the payoff i get from beeing the next round and then beeing last again is ridiculusly lousy. i better just wait out, because beeing 2nd or 1st, or even beeing third is not that of a big deal, only beeing last sux.

That is a good little 'game theory' puzzle.
- If you are the only player that does it, then you are no better off than just waiting for it to come round.
- If the player sat opposite you does it, then you'll both be going 1st and 3rd every time. That's better than 2nd and 4th
- If 3 of the 4 players do it, you never get to go first

so 4 player game, if im last atm and i dont take starting player, im 3rd next round, then 2nd, then 1st.
if i take it, im 1st next round and then again fking last the round after, so i loose 1 action to be first next round and then be last again??

Yes.  But you probably aren’t using your first action of the round to do it... so you’re trading a third/fourth/fifth action (when a lot of spots aren’t available or are expensive)  for a first action in the following round.  Plus you’re straight up getting two fame which isn’t bad.
Imagine you have a 3 silk, 3 wheat, 3 tea market in your tableau.  If you get one of the “score three different markets without using a die” actions (which are limited) in the next round that’s nine coins you score and potentially nine coins the player who doesn’t get to take that action doesn’t score.  If people have built markets, there will be a huge contest for start player just for that reason.  Heck someone who only get four coins out of that action may fight for start player just to deny me the chance to get my nine coins!

That is a good little 'game theory' puzzle.
- If you are the only player that does it, then you are no better off than just waiting for it to come round.

- If 3 of the 4 players do it, you never get to go first

What Spanna said is very true. But aren't you going 3rd and 2nd if the player opposite takes it?
Taking 1st player is mostly NOT worth it unless:
- it allows you to get a fame track reward
- the 2 people after you keep taking 1st player and make you 3rd/4th player repeatedly (argh, esp if they have no good reason)
- you need the '3 markets' spot next round to get a money track reward (+ unless you took 1st player, you will not be 1st or 2nd player next round)
- next round will be the last round
- you are just behind the leader in "points" AND the leader is sitting in front of you
- you do not have karma to convert it to a '6' for building or river jump
- the next river spot does not benefit you immediately
- the colour of the dice in the 'convert 1 dice to 2 dice' is not what you need for building
Guys, coming from a high ranked player on Yucata, taking the 1st player should not be your top choice unless you have very good reasons. There are many options for a '1' dice (see above).

I was initially skeptical but have since changed my view.
There are a few advantages to using Master Building (#5), namely:
- converts dead ends to live paths (which translates to creating dead ends to get yield rewards and then over-building to continue the path)
- gives the ability to snag a tile if you do not have enough dice of the same colour to build the conventional way
- saves coins.
Do note the above advantages has to be weighed against not advancing your path (since you are replacing and not adding a new tile).

Master Builder (5) is coin free! When you sell first, quary spaces could get to 3-4 coins quite fast, no problem for Master Builder! And it's ideal to connect yield tiles with some cheaper crossroad, get the bonuses and use Master Builder for same tile in future. Imho it's quite essential if you are playing for "2 fame per bend tile" brown yield tile. You do not loose yield bonuses and you can have many bend tiles in time of bronw yield connection is made.

What Spanna said is very true. But aren't you going 3rd and 2nd if the player opposite takes it?

Aha I was meaning both you and the player opposite taking it (in turn). They take it so you go 3rd, you take it and go 1st, they take it so you go 3rd and so on

I said "later in the game". Usually this is after youve hit your endgame brown bonus.
Dont underestimate being able to be flexible on colors. When its late in the game, being able to just get a 5 and then getting little dice of every color makes it so that you can stay on a roll and have a much better change of getting a high impact tile. Where as if you keep rolling a single color in hopes of getting 2 that add up to a high number, based on a high value tile out there, it is much easier for someone to snake that tile out from under you. And then if something else good doesnt come up, you are stuck with the wrong colors.
Overall, Im not saying the 5 pip tile will ALWAYS be better. But if no one in your group is going for it, I would suggest try using it in the late game and see how good it feels.

- you need the '3 markets' spot next round to get a money track reward (+ unless you took 1st player, you will not be 1st or 2nd player next round)

If you need the 3 markets spot then the consideration isn’t just “if I don’t take 1st, I won’t be 1st or 2nd player next round, and won’t get that spot”... it’s also “What if the guy after me takes 1st player, either to get it himself, or to deny me”

Yes, I agree with you, which is why I quoted Spanna's "Game theory and also my 2nd point
- the 2 people after you keep taking 1st player and make you 3rd/4th player repeatedly (argh, esp if they have no good reason)
It also feels so good but wrong to have the player before you keep taking 1st player...then you are usually 2nd in turn order

- you need the '3 markets' spot next round to get a money track reward (+ unless you took 1st player, you will not be 1st or 2nd player next round)

Yes, but even if they haven’t been previously, towards the end of the game it may be smart for them to do so.  If I’m threatening to win, denying me the 3 markets spot, if it is very good for me, is the smart play.

That's a good reason too.

Also if you are doing really well on money from the market spots, the 2 fame from taking first player is not trivial at all.

Early game I see it taken most frequently to guarantee players utilising the chamber they want, later in the game it's more likely to be to guarantee access to the market space they want. I don't think I've used that space myself, but it's got regular use, more so than the 5 pip and 6 pip slots

I’ve literally never seen anyone use the five pip spot.

Then you might want to play a bit more. You can build around the spot for endgame which might safe you quite some money (which is very nice last round) and steel tiles from others which built up dice of a special colour. There is some discussion of it in this excellent thread:
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2177187/article/32694067#32...

One of the bonus yield tiles (brown) gives you 2 coins for each yield tile you’ve reached. We assumed these don’t include the pre printed yield spaces on the board therefore only scoring for those tiles you’ve added. Is this correct.
Thanks in advance.

That's correct. It says tiles, not spaces. The same is true in the German rules.

Thanks Eric. The confusion came from the description of the spaces as yields in the main rules but then referring to yield tiles in the expansion. Would have been an extremely strong tile if it gave you the bonus for both!

I still felt that that tile was over powered my sister scored 18 points on it.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Really enjoy this game, but some of the pieces are beginning to show wear. Any good aftermarket goodies? Custom meeples, cardboard replacements?

just but a new copy of the game?

I'd be surprised if the meeples are a problem - perhaps a fresh lick of paint is all they'd need.
If it's the tokens, then coin capsules are an option, possibly just for the grey tokens that see most action when I play
The elephant 1st player marker might also tale some wear, so a mini certainly possible, though many people seem to like the cardboard one in the game

HUCH! has announced two new additions to the

family arriving this summer: Goodie Box #2 (which will include Blessings of Kedarnath) and The Dice Charmers, a roll-and-write version of the game.
News source:
Brettspielbox

Very interesting!
When they labeled the first Goodie Box as #1, I hadn't heard whether the series was specifically for Rajas, or whether #2 might turn out to be for some completely unrelated game. Nice to see they'll be even more Rajas material.
I wonder if perhaps it will get to a point at which they'll release everything in both (or all, if there's even more to come) Goodie Boxes as an actual expansion? If they do, I really, really hope there isn't even more additional content not previously released in the Goodie Boxes. Been there, done that, did not enjoy it.

That is super interesting!

All of these expansions are nice but does this new one fix province tile variety?  I would like to see another 50 or so province tiles.  The ability to pick some and leave some out of the game so you never know what tiles will be available.

How come there's no BGG page for the Dice Charmers? (i.e. the roll and write)
It's on preorder at a UK store but I can't seem to find any proper information about the game nor a photo of the components, etc.
Any ideas?

For anyone still subscribed to this thread, some more info (including a picture of the box cover) on Dice Charmers is at this link:

Google Translated into English:
Rajas of the Ganges is also being transformed into a Roll n Write game.
With eight symbol cubes, the players try to expand their province, collect goods and sell them in the market, win over influential personalities in the palace and sail up and down the river on the Ganges.
Like in the big brother, there is a race on the scales of wealth and fame in the form of two opposing bars.

Has anybody made a custom playmat for RAJAS... places for the tiles included? Then I would really like to get the picture.
Thanks, Dirk

For market tiles that have two sets of markets, each with 1 coin next to the respective set of markets, how are they scored?
When any market on the tile is scored, are both coins scored or only the one adjacent to the market being scored?
First time playing and this question is driving me nuts.
My current assumption is that only the adjacent coin is scored.

Hi Kent
The one next to that specific market.
To be more specific
- If doing a 3 different goods valuation (one of the bottom 2 market valuation spots), then find you highest cloth, highest spice and highest tea
The sum of those is what you get in coins e.g. a market valuation when you have a single tile containing 1 coin for spice and one coin for tea, is 2 coins (you've got no cloth market to value).
If you later add another tile with a 3 coins for spice, then a future such valuation would now net you 4 coins, 3 for the 3 coin spice and one for the tea (and still no cloth)
Then if you later add a tile with 2 coin tea and 2 coin cloth, a market valuation would reap 2 + 2 + 3  = 7 coins
- If doing a single goods valuation, then you just score that type of good, and can count as many as th number of the die you give up. E.g. in the scenario above where you now have
1 coin and 3 coin spice, 1 coin and 2 coin tea, 2 coin cloth
if you give up a '1' die, then you could get 3 coins for the spice, but if the die was a '2' then you'd get 3+1 = 4 coins
However for cloth, it wouldn't matter what die you gave up, you only have 1 cloth market, so that's all you'll score (2 coins)
I hope this helps

Thanks. We played correctly.
I understood the rules except for the ambiguity that did not explicitly specify that money was earned for only the adjacent coin. The English rules only talk about the money earned in reference to the tile more or less.

So you don;t need to use a die when you take the spot where you get the highest value market in each of the three types?

Correct, you DON'T pay die when taking this action. It's very nicely visible - upper line (single type selling) there is die with "?" inside the worker square, bottom line (selling one of each type) has no die inside the square, nevertheless it's limited by color - only one meeple per player per complete round.
Iconography in the game is quite clear:
- inside worker square -> need to pay
- outside worker sq. -> reward
- only ONE exception -> River -> You need to pay die (with value 1-3) ALWAYS althoght it's not depictured inside the squere. It's because it can cost you both die and coins.

Hi Kent
To be more specific
- If doing a 3 different goods valuation (one of the bottom 2 market valuation spots), then find you highest cloth,
highest spice and highest spice.

Is this a typo? You wouldn`t score spice twice if you`ve selected the 3 different goods space.

Yes, it’s a typo.

well spotted  - will correct

The master builder action says the tile must match. I’m not sure why you would want or need to place a matching tile onto a province space? What is the benefit? Is it just so you can have a different road structure?

The master builder action says the tile must match. I’m not sure why you would want or need to place a matching tile onto a province space? What is the benefit? Is it just so you can have a different road structure?

It’s because of a poor translation. The German says you need a suitable tile, i.e., one that leaves all the tiles connected to the palace once you play it.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am in the midst of a 2p game on yucata.de where I have 5 green dice (Mango expansion was a key driver).  It occurred to me to wonder how the game would play out if there were 3 dice per color per player instead of the full dice pool.  Has anyone tried it?  Did it add any tension?

I do. Always. It's obvious for me (and my group) that crucial resources, as dice, must be scaled.

It's a race game, so limiting dice more  gives more opportunity for blocking by hogging a single colour and while I cna see that makes it more tactical, I'm not sure that it makes it more fun.
Play however it makes it more fn for you. It's a pretty light and linear game so I'm fine with it as it is.

I wouldn't adjust number of dice per colour, but if I really have to I would add a buffer of 0.5 dice per player (rounded up) because it might be overly tight.
Although to be honest, I have never felt constrained by dice colour in 4P games. When 2-3 ppl have >= 3 dice, the others usually will not go for the same colour. Strictly using 3 dice per players can lead to a constraint that doesn't exist in the 4P game.

We've never been close to running out in a 4P game, so I'd never even given this thought before. For me there is enough in the game without trying to generate additional tightness.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi
So in our last play of this game a question came up:
Can a player use the market action, especially the free mixed market action, without having any market tile in his/her province? The player did this to block another player who would otherwise have won the game.
Thanks
Alex

Hi Alex
It feels legitimate - they value their markets, which just happen to be 0. By doing so they are blocking either goods of the specified type or the 'one of each' market valuation, but not the other (I presume the other was already filled).
Worth checking whether the rules stipulate that they must have at least one market tile to perform this action, but in the absence of such a rule definition, I personally would allow it.
It's not a take that game at all, but occasionally there are groans as a space is taken up by another player. This is the first example I've encountered where someone can directly stuff up another player's plans.
It would certainly amuse me if someone did that and then the other player moved on the river to hit a market valuation space
Regards
Ian

Thanks for the quick reply!

Yeah we couldn't find such a rule, so we came to the same conclusion. It just says you "may" value your markets.

It would certainly amuse me if someone did that and then the other player moved on the river to hit a market valuation space

This was not an option, but would indeed be a nice counter
Nevertheless it led to a very tight finale.

There was some discussion on this a while back but no definitive answer.
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1925187/pay-cost-do-not-get...
.
My view was the rules permit it.
Interestingly in looking back through the rules the “may” that is present in the market action space rules isn’t present in the quarry. When building it says “you acquire” with no “may”. So you couldn’t take the last space, pay and not build I would say.
That may imply the two different wordings are intentionally different. But it may not
.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Rule :
Choose any of the palace actions 2 - 6 (Dancer, Yogi, Raja,
Master builder or Portuguese) and carry it out immediately
without placing a worker in the palace or giving up a die
(the space in the palace may even be occupied).
My doubt is  I get the palace action free completely ?
I do not pay any one worker and one die that is Specified ?
Either worker or die should be choosen for free ?

You've paid already with worker/die for the river action (plus maybe money, albeit it might be 0$). So yes, the palace action is otherwise free.

This is exactly the rule that's implemented on yucata.de so I'm pretty sure it's free.

Hi
I would like to know if I can return a die with karma only when I roll it, or if I can use  karma to return a die which is already on my kali statue only when I want to use this die
Thanks
Philippe

You use your Karma only then, when it is convenient for you to do so.
Keep the dice and wait for when you really need to use your Karma

return = flip to the other side?

return = flip to the other side?

Yes. Something got lost in translation.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi
I would like to know if I can use karma to return a dice only when I roll this dice, or can I also use karma to change the value of one of my dice which is on the kali statue?
Thanks
Philippe

We play it that you can do so at any point, so yes to when it is on Kali statue

If it official?
Because in the rules, it's "one karma allows you to turn any die on your kali statue to the opposite side WHEN YOU PLACE IT"
Thanks
Philippe

Hi Phillipe
I think it depends on your interpretation of 'when you place it'.
I've taken that to mean the act of taking it from your Kali statue and placing it on the board (rather thn placing on the Kali statue)
I'm interested to hear other views - it may be that I am wrong
Regards
Ian

I think your answer is good

The German rules are quite clear and specifically say:
"You can use one Karma to turn one die on your Kali statue to its opposite side, when you activate it [the die*]."
EDIT: *[added myself for clarity]

Because in the rules, it's "one karma allows you to turn any die on your kali statue to the opposite side WHEN YOU PLACE IT"

Means "when placing it on an action space", not placing on Kali statue.

Because in the rules, it's "one karma allows you to turn any die on your kali statue to the opposite side WHEN YOU PLACE IT"

Means "when placing it on an action space", not placing on Kali statue.

I do understand the confusion with the English rules though, as in this game, you actually place your meeples, not your dice. Dice are just spent.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my first review for BGG. I've really enjoyed Rajas so far so it seems like a great game to start with! I love midweight Euros and a big appeal of this game for me was the stated 60-75 minute play time. I often play games with coworkers at lunch and we have an hour to play. For that reason, I don't get to play heavier games like Great Western Trail very often. Games that have seen regular play lately include Rajas, Tiny Towns, Tournay, Jaws, Res Arcana and Century: Spice Road.
I bought Rajas of the Ganges a few weeks ago after months of delayed gratification... it's been on my wishlist for a while. I've spent a fair amount of time traveling in India so the theme was automatically a win for me.
The art and components are fantastic. 48 dice of varying colors, wooden meeples, nice thick tiles for province building. I also really love the Kali component for storing dice. The only component I've found lacking is the player 1 elephant - sure, it's cute, but it easily falls apart. This is nitpicking, though.
I have played this game at 2, 3 and 4 players and have loved it at all counts. Turns go fairly quickly. Interaction is indirect but there's a fair amount of tension due to the competition for building tiles and placing workers. I always find myself paying attention to the turns of others.
Rajas also combines dice rolling, tile laying and worker placement in an extremely satisfying combination.
The worker placement vibe gives me a Lords of Waterdeep feel, which is a big positive. Players start with 3 workers but can unlock up to two more, so all players are racing to get an advantage (however brief) where they get additional actions in a turn.
The tile laying comes into play when building out provinces that include markets (for money) and monuments (for fame) - plus reaching certain spots leads to bonuses. This adds a nice, classic Carcassonne vibe. The individual player boards for provinces are excellent and the rules for building out provinces are simple yet engaging.
The dice rolling aspect is also excellent. I hate luck-based games and I'm generally not a fan of dice. Games like King of Tokyo bore the heck out of me. However, I love games where I can mitigate and/or manipulate dice, and this is one area where ROTG really shines. Dice are rolled as soon as they are acquired. I am almost always excited by what I roll because I have so many options.
Low rolls can be turned to high rolls by using karma (and high rolls are desirable for gaining buildings). However, low rolls can be desirable in their own right - for instance, the dancer can only be activated with a die roll of 2 (which results in 2 fresh dice to add to a player's pool along with a bonus tile) and the yogi is activated with a die roll of 3 (a free die plus 2 karma). Each player also has a boat on the river that can be moved only with a roll of 1-3, triggering special bonuses. In the rare instances I get a mediocre roll and find myself stuck, it's generally because I haven't done a good job replenishing karma.
My gaming group have found multiple strong strategies for winning this game. Being resourceful with dice and balancing fame and money are all important. Also, everyone I've played with so far (4 other people plus myself) have all really liked this game.
Best of all, this game can be played in about an hour. I played a 3-player game a few days ago that was tense, thinky and immersive and led to all three players nearly winning the game despite the fact that we all pursued drastically different strategies. I was amazed that we completed the game in an hour. It felt like we'd played a meatier game, which is a huge plus for me. As much as I'd like to bring a big ol' Euro to the table at lunch, it's just not an option for us at work!
I give this game a 9 out of 10 (and I haven't given any games a 10 just yet, so 9 is as high as I go). Highly recommended!

Nice review and nice to see someone not complaining about one strategy being stronger than all others
I love this game and play it whenever I get the a chance at it.

I think its a pretty underrated game.
It doesnt necessarily have a whole bunch of strategies and routes to victory to explore compared to some of the other praised euros. But I like it for that reason. Its more about adapting to the board, your dice rolls and your opponents rather than "what strategy am I going to explore today" (until you run out of strategies to explore).
It has plenty of decisions space every turn and plays super fast once everyone knows what they are doing, without feeling light at all.

I've seen plenty of complaints about a "money-heavy" strategy being the only way to go and I took a picture of my last game to prove that's not the case:

* Yellow player triggered the game end with fame and money being almost exactly balanced.
* Red player (me) had fame and money overlap by 2 during last turn, taking the lead. I admit to having a very money-heavy strategy.
* Green player tied with me despite having a very fame-heavy strategy.
I won due to the tiebreaker. It looked like green was going to win most of the game and a few different decisions at the end would've led to a win for him.
All of those approaches can lead to a win!
And yes, it's not Great Western Trail... why should it be? Plenty of great decisions and strategies to keep this game fun and engaging for a long time!

I think its a pretty underrated game.

it's ranked in the top 200... if there's one thing this game is not, is underrated, specially considering it has been rated by almost 6,000 users... It's evident that whoever owns this game, does also really enjoy this game.

Top 200 might not be underrated, but I do think this one is worthy of cracking the top 100. I'd take it over other similarly weighted worker placement games like Stone Age and Lords of Waterdeep (though I like the latter a lot)... and those are both top 100.

Glad to read another review of this wonderful game! Love me some Rajas. There's a goodie box coming out by the end of this year

A goodie box??!! I will keep an eye out for that...
Also curious to see if this game will eventually get some more expansions. That will also probably help for staying power in the rankings.

The goodie box does that. Adds expansions to the games. They are minor though. More like adding modules to add more spaces or different type of tiles into the game. There was a promo that added the first module (or mini expansion called mango village). There are a few promos that add different tiles with powers other than the regular market or building tiles. The goodie box will include the mango village with 2 new tiles, and add 2 new modules into the game with a few other things.

Who do I wrote or email to if I am missing a yield tile? I can't seem to find the website for HUCH games. Do I wrote to the USA distributor?

You should get in touch with whoever distributes the game in your country.

For Europe contact:

Who is the distributor in Canada? A poster from the USA who dealt with them gave me  this link

I have filled out their from 5 days ago., Keeping fingers crossed.

I've reached out to R&R at least 5 times over the last year and have never received a reply or replacement parts. The last time I met them at a con and asked what was the best way to request replacement parts and I was given a business card of a person to email.  That was back in May so far I have heard nothing back from the email I sent to that person. I'm guessing that I'm out of luck.
I wish you luck in getting the parts you need.

the worker on the bridge do you get it when you cross the bridge?

Rules:

The inactive worker on the river doesn’t have his own river space (the bridge doesn’t count as a river space); that means, when your boat has passed the bridge, you take the worker of your color.

agreed - albeit always remember that if you've already collected the other two bonus workers, you don't collect the third

agreed - albeit always remember that if you've already collected the other two bonus workers, you don't collect the third

It depends. You can in the advanced rules.

General view is that advanced version is the "real" game.
I totally agree. Makes the game soooo much better.

Randomisers for the river. Under variants at the back of the rules.

They're for the Ganga module; you place them randomly on the river to replace existing actions.

Is the yields square at the bottom of the board a junction to the roads?
I thought it was but another player corrected me and said it isn't.
He said to get there you must connect a road to it but you cannot branch out of it. Is that true? I couldn't find anything explicit in the rule book except to say all roads have to have a connection back to the residence. This implies the box is not a road junction?

I had always assumed it isn't a junction mainly because that would make it too easy to get all of the big bonuses at the bottom of the board.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Only got 3 today.

Miraculix

Yes! This is definitely one of the best worker placement games for three players - would always recommend it!

This

if you are all beginners, yes. Otherwise, the 2 '3 market' spots makes money strat even stronger.

Great game, we played with 3 and the 5 worker limit. Took us an hour to read and understand the rules though we are not beginners.

I played it at all player counts. I think it is well balanced as easy to learn and to play.
A light-medium-weight worker placement game with very nice artwork!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A mini review after 11 plays, taken and from our blog

Ganges is a dice worker placement race game.  Players begin with three workers, four differently coloured dice, and markers on both a money and fame tracks which run both ways round the edge of the board.  It is a race to whoever can get their money and fame markers to meet, players choose whether to generate more money or fame, though often a mix is best.  Many of the worker placement spots also require use of one or more of your dice, so keeping a good supply of these is important.  The simplest spaces gain a die or swap one colour for two of a different colour.   Next is the river that allows moving one to three spaces to gain a bonus, which can be anything from more money, more dice, fame or market trading.  The building action allows dice of one colour, usually two or three, to be traded for a tile to place on your player board, which will either establish a market or build a temple.  Markets gain money, while temples gain fame.  Tiles need to be connected by roads back to your castle and building to the edge of the board can gain additional bonuses of money, fame or dice.
The market action allows trading at one or more of your existing markets and can be a big source of money.  The first worker placed at the river, market or building is free, while later ones cost a few coins, moving you back on the money track, so getting in first each round is important.  Lastly there are a set of six action spaces each corresponding to one die value, which give various benefits including more dice, the ability to cheaply overbuild an existing tile or gaining some fame and the first player marker.  There is also a karma track where spending a point allows a die to be flipped to its opposite side, adding some mitigation to the rolls made each time a die is gained.
Each of the four temple types are to begin with worth two fame points when built, this can be enhanced up to four points by moving up temple specific tracks, which can make a big difference to the points gained and provide some focus when choosing which tiles to build.  Up to two more workers can be gained by moving past trigger points on the fame, money and river tracks, the last of the three not being gained. Having as many workers as the other players is essential to not being left behind so you need to watch how others are progressing.  The personal boards come with two sides, one simpler and the other more difficult, providing a small expansion as well as a way to cater for differing degrees of experience.
This is a good game and scales well from two to four, though is better at the higher player counts due to more interaction and less predictability, as well as more churn in the building tiles.
We have come to the conclusion race games aren’t our thing and in general they don’t work so well at two players.  Usually one player gets ahead and the other finds it hard to keep up, which is not something we find fun as the player behind gets despondent and the lead player isn’t being challenged.  We don’t don’t enjoy games where it is clear who as won long before the end.  This wasn’t a case of one player being consistently better as the wins were fairly even.  This game teetered on the edge for some time but after playing it a number of times we came to realise that it just wasn’t for us and has now been sold on.
Good Points
Components are lovely, especially the dice and colourful board
Scales well from two to four, with a double sided board to help
Something good to do with all die values, so rolling sixes does not give a huge advantage.
Combination of workers and dice is unusual and interesting
Bad points
Available buildings are fairly static in a two player game
Getting off to a slow start almost guarantees that you will lose the game.
Theme is barely present
Regularly moving small distances on the money track, often multiple times in a turn, can be quite fiddly.
In summary a good game, but not for those who dislike racing
.

Try The Quest for El Dorado, a superb racing game for two.

Try The Quest for El Dorado, a superb racing game for two.

Thanks for the suggestion.  We had that a year or so ago and didn’t get on with it.  One of us was much, much better at it and despite adding a handicap it was more frustrating than fun.  That’s not a fault in the game though, which we agree is good.

Just wanted to post this here to say hey, Huch and the Brands, you should really consider giving

maurogibertoni’s labor-of-love automa deck

the official treatment: testing, tweaks, art. It’s a really clever deck that works so well in creating a nice amount of board-jockeying tension and in having the automa set a brisk scoring pace. And it’s almost totally seamless.
Would love to see this picked up as an official promo pack, it’s that good.

I´ve just played this variant, and I have to say that I really liked it. The game lasted only 40 minutes, since the automa actions are easy to play. He beated me, his scoring rate is as if he were a skilled player.
Thanks for the recommendation!

I just played it twice for the first time today and also thoroughly enjoyed it.

Inka und Markus Brand sind seit Jahren Garanten für schön gefeiltes Gameplay, dass durch abwechslungsreiche, schön verzanhnte Mechnismen glänzt. So auch im hier vorliegenden Fall von Rajas of the Ganges, bei dem wir uns ins indische Mogulreich begeben und versuchen uns als Landesherrscher zu behaupten indem wir zwischen Ansehen und Reichtum abwägen müssen. Auch dieses Spiel der Brands, soviel sei vorweg gesagt, braucht, wenn man es mit der vollen Besetzung spielen möchte wieder recht viel Tischfläche. Dafür sieht das farbenfrohe Spielmaterial auf dem Tisch absolut fantastisch aus, denn beim auspacken fallen uns sofort jede Menge bunte Würfel, Plättchen und Spielfiguren in die Hände und der Spielplan sucht seinesgleichen an Detailvielfalt. Der Ersteindruck kann erschlagen, aber wie sind die Regeln?
Worum geht es ?
Zunächst aber nochmal zum Hintergrund und Spielziel. Die Spieler verkörpern Rajas und Ranis im indischen Mogulreich, das vor Reichtum nur so strotzt. Sie stehen im Wettstreit, nein es ist sogar eine Art Wettlauf, um Reichtum und Ruhm. Um diese beiden Dinge zu erreichen bauen die Spieler ihre eignen Provinzen mit Hilfe ihrer Arbeiter zu produktiven und Ansehen bringenden Reichen aus. Rajas of the Ganges hat dabei einen recht einzigartigen Siegbedingungsmechanismus, denn um das Spielfeld laufen zwei Leisten, eine für Ruhm und eine für Reichtum. Auf einer läuft man links herum auf der anderen rechts und wenn sich die Markierungssteine beider Leisten begegnen, startet das Spielende und derjenige der sie am weitesten aneinander vorbeiziehen hat lassen, gewinnt.
Wie läuft das ab ?
Jeder Spieler bekommt zu Beginn eine ganze Menge an persönlichem Spielmaterial. Mit von der Partie sind ein eigenes Provinztableau, eine Kalistatue, an die und auf der man Würfel legen muss, sowie sechs Arbeiterfiguren, fünf Karmasteine, ein Boot, sowie je einen Geld-, Bonus- und Ruhmesmarker. In die Mitte des Tisches wird das Spielbrett gelegt, dass über verschiedene Elemente verfügt. Auf der linken Seite des Spielbretts befindet sich der Palast mit vielen verschiedenen einsetzmöglichkeiten. Über ihm findet sich die Karmaweganzeige, auf der auf Stufe eins einer der karmawürfel der Spieler gesetzt wird. Getrennt wird das Spielbrett grob in zwei Hälften durch einen Flußlauf mit vielen Feldern. Auf dem Startfeld des Flusses platzieren die Spieler ihre Boote. Die rechte Hälfte des Spielplans nehmen einige Gebäude und Entwicklungsleisten ein. Auf den Gebäuden sind wieder jede Menge Einsetzfelder und auf die leisten wird jeweils in die erste Spalte ein Karmamarker der Spieler als Anzeiger gesetzt. Die Kalistatue und drei der Arbeiter legen die Spieler direkt vor sich ab. die anderen drei Arbeiter werden auf das Spielbrett gelegt. Auf den beiden das Spielfeld umlaufenden Leisten gibt es jeweils ein Feld, auf denen ein Arbeiter abgelgt wird und auch auf dem Fluß gibt es an einer Stelle eine Brücke auf der ein Arbeiter abgelegt wird. Diese Arbeiter können im Verlauf des Spiels erst hinzugewonnen werden. Zum Schluß bekommt jeder Spieler einen Würfel in jeder der vier Farben und würfelt mit ihnen. Dann werden sie an die Statuen angelegt und derjenige mit dem insgesamt geringsten Gesamtergebnis wird Startspieler. Alle anderen Würfel werden bereitgelegt.
Als letzte Vorbereitung werden noch die Plättchen nach Rückseiten sortiert. Zunächst gibt es auch diese einmal in vier verschiedenen Farben. Nach der Farbsortierung werden sie noch nach den Rückseitensymbolen getrennt. Die Rückseiten zeigen entweder eine Schlage, eine Kuh oder einen Tiger. So ergibt sich eine Auslage aus zwölf Stapeln, die neben das Spielbrett gelegt werden. Eine Menge an Vorbereitung und eine Menge an Material das nun auf dem Tisch liegt.
Der Spielverlauf ist dann aber erfreulich einfach und glänzt nur durch eine hohe Komplexität der Möglichkeiten. Im Grunde ist Rajas of the Ganges ein Worker-Placement-Spiel, in dem zusätzlich Würfel als eine Art Zahlungsmittel eingesetzt werden. Eine Runde besteht im Grunde nur aus dem Einsetzen aller Arbeiter der Spieler. Danach bekommen alle ihre Arbeiter zurück und die nächste Runde beginnt. Das passiert solange bis oben bereits beschriebenen Spielendebedingung eintrifft.
Es gibt vier Bereiche in denen die Arbeiter eingesetzt werden können: den Palast, den Steinbruch, den Marktplatz und den Hafen. Die letzten drei sind alle neben den Gebäuden auf dem Spielplan angesiedelt. Im Steinbruch kann man Bauaktionen erlangen, um sein eigenes Provinztableau zu erweitern. Auf dem Marktplatz kann man vor allem im späteren Spielverlauf Geld verdienen. Der Palast dient zweierlei Dingen, zum einen kann man hier wichtige Personen treffen und durch sie Vergünstigungen erhalten und zum anderen kann man hier Würfel bekommen und tauschen. Maximal 10 Würfel darf man an seiner Kalistatue anlegen, die Farben sind dabei egal und die Werte ebenso. Wann immer man einen neuen Würfel erhält, würfelt man ihn und bekommt ihn mit der angezeigten Augenzahl in seinen Vorrat. Im Hafen zu guter letzt kann man Arbeiter einsetzen, um das eigene Schiff auf dem Fluß vorwärts zu bewegen und Boni zu erhalten.
Weiter ins Detail bei den Aktionen werde ich erstmal nicht gehen nur punktuell, um etwas zu verdeutlichen. Die Felder auf dem Spielfeld gibt es in verschiedenen Varianten. Manchmal sind sie leer, dann ist die entsprechende Aktion kostenlos, manchmal kostet sie den Einsatz eines bestimmten Würfels oder Gold. Die Bauaktionen im Steinbruch kosten je nach Feld ein bis vier Gold für das einsetzen des Arbeiters. Im Anschluß darf man sich eines der ausliegenden Plättchen nehmen, wenn man seine Kosten auch noch bezahlen kann, denn auf den Plättchen ist immer eine Würfelfarbe mit einem Wert angegeben, der bezahlt werden muss. Zum Beispiel bedeutet ein blauer Würfel mit einer sieben, dass man insgesamt Würfel mit sovielen Augen mindestens abgeben muss. Zahlt man mehr, so bekommt man aber auch nichts zurück. Die Plättchen dienen dann unserem Provinzausbau. Unser Provinztableau zeigt am Rand überall Boni, die wir erreichen können, wenn wir sie korrekt mit Straßen anschließen. Ansonsten sind auf den Plättchen mehrere Gebäude abgibildet für die wir Ruhmespunkte oder Gold bekommen. Die Ruhmespunkte richten sich dabei nach unseren Gebäudeleisten, auf denen wir am Anfang die Marker platziert haben. Je besser hier der Ausbau, desto mehr Punkte.
Im Markt bekommt man Geld für Marktplätze in der Provinz. Dabei ist es wichtig, welche Märkte mit welchen Waren man werten möchte, denn es gibt Seide, Gewürze und Tee als Waren und die jeweiligen Märkte lassen sich über die Arbeiterfelder auch auswählen. Hier generiert man das Gold für die Goldleiste.
Der Palast ermöglicht es auf vielen Feldern Würfel einer gewünschten Farbe zu bekommen, oder einen Würfel einer Farbe gegen zwei Würfel einer anderen Farbe einzutauschen. Darüber hinaus gibt es noch sechs Felder, die sogenannten Gemächer, mit Personen, die man aufsuchen kann und bei denen man besondere Vergünstigungen erhält. Als Beispiel sei hier der Großmogul genannt, bei dem man einen Würfel mit der Augenzahl von eins abgeben muss und dafür zwei Ruhmespunkte und den Startspielerstein für die nächste Runde erhält.
Zum Schluss sei noch der Hafen erwähnt, indem man für 0-2 Gold einen Arbeiter einsetzen kann und anschließend sein Boot um ein bis drei Felder auf dem Fluß vorwärts ziehen darf. Man erhält dann die belohnung des Feldes auf dem man zum stehen kommt. Wichtig dabei ist noch, dass Felder auf denen anderen Boote stehen nicht mitzählen und man sie überspringt.
Ziel ist es nun durch all diese miteinander verzahnten Aktionen, die beiden Leisten möglichst schnell aneinander vorbei zu bewewgen, um Rajas of the Ganges zu gewinnen. Die Komplexität eerhält das Spiel dabei wirklich aus der Vielzahl an Möglichkeiten und wie sie miteinander funktionieren. Deshalb würde ich es als Kennerspiel einordnen, aber auch nicht mehr. Es ist dabei nicht ganz so strategisch wie zum Beispiel ein Teotihuacan, bei dem man noch ein wenig mehr vorrausplanen muss, was man tut. Das schadet hier zwar auch nicht, aber es gibt immer genug Möglichkeiten weiter voranzukommen.
Das Fazit
Was mir an Rajas of the Ganges wirklich wahnsinnig gut gefällt, ist die Einfachheit des eigentlichen Spielmechanismusses, den man natürlich schon hunderte Male genau so gesehen hat: setze einen Arbeiter auf ein Feld und bekomme eine Gegenleistung dafür. Mehr ist es im Prinzip ja nicht. Die Besonderheiten bei Rajas of The Ganges rühren zum einen von den Würfeln her, die hier als Ressource gebraucht werden, um bestimmte Aktionen bezahlen zu können. Dabei spielen sowohl Farbe als auch Augenzahl eine Rolle und das ist eine recht clevere Art für eine variable Ressource in einem solchen Spiel. Zum Zweiten von der wirklich weitreichenden Verzahnung der einzelnen Elemente: wir benötigen einen Arbeiter für eine bestimmte Aktion, wir benötigen einen bestimmten Würfel zur Bezahlung, wir benötigen Plättchen für den Ausbau mit bestimmten Gebäuden, wir benötigen Gebäude für Ruhm und Gold, wir benötigen beides um schnell voran zu kommen. Phänomenal überlegt.
Man hat soviele Möglichkeiten in Rajas of the Ganges zum Ziel zu kommen. Der eine setzt auf die Boni auf dem Fluß, der andere auf einen schnellen Ausbau seiner Provinz und der nächste versucht seine Leisten direkt nach vorne zu bringen. Die Brands haben hier ein wirklich gutes Spiel abgeliefert. Ein Spiel bei dem man immer gerne mitspielt. Es ist nicht das ganz große Highlight, warum kann ich gar nicht genau sagen, vielleicht weil der eigentliche Mechanismus dann doch eher simpel ist. Aber das Spielgefühl das Rajas of the Ganges vermittelt ist einfach toll. Eigentlich hätte es ein Spitzenkandidat für die Kennerspiel des Jahres Nominierung in seinem Jahrgang sein müssen, war es aber irgendwie nicht. Hier kann ein jeder Freund von Worker-Placement-Spielen bedenkenlos zugreifen und wird seine Freude damit haben. Tolles Material, tolles Spielgefühl, tolle Mechanismen, einfach ein tolles Spiel!
