Rajas of the Ganges
Set-Up:
 ° Place the game board in the middle of the table, according to the player count.
  -- If playing with 3 players, use the 2 “space cover” markers to cover the 1st Quarry space and the 3rd Harbor space.
  -- If playing the “standard game,” put the Yellow, Brown and Red yield tokens, and the 8 river tokens, in the box.
   ---See below for details on the Navaratnas Version and the Ganga Module (2 variants to the game!)
 ° Sort the “Province Tiles” by color, and then by the 3 different animal backs (snake, cow, tiger).
  -- Place the 12 stacks face-down next to the board, then flip the top tile of each stack face-up.
 ° Mix the 8 white “Yield” tokens face-down on the temple space (white building).
 ° Each player takes:
  -- 1 Province board (place the “standard” side up – the side without blank yield spots)
  -- 1 Kali Statue board (with the 2 slots in the middle open for dice – able to hold 10 dice (that’s all it does, fyi))
  -- 6 Workers (lay 1 worker sideways on the river bridge,
  --n the 15 fame space, and on the 20 money space)
  -- 5 Cubes (1 on level 1 of the Karma track, and 1 on the leftmost space of the 4 buildings, right side of board)
  -- 1 Money marker (start space to be determined when first player is chosen – see below)
  -- 1 Fame marker (put on “0” space of the Fame track)
  -- 1 Boat (put on start space of the river)
  -- 1 Money Track Bonus marker (put on space 12 of the money track, blue (river) side up)
  -- 1 die of each color (Green, Blue, Yellow, Purple) – roll them, place each die onto an empty hand of Kali Statue.
 ° The player with the lowest total on their 4 dice will be Start Player. They take the Elephant marker (start player marker.
)
  -- The 1st player’s money marker goes on space 3. 2nd/3rd/4th player put their money marker on space 4/5/6.
Game Flow:
 ° Rajas of the Ganges is played over a number of rounds until 1 player triggers the end of the game by having their Fame
and Money marker intersect paths. At this point, remaining players in turn order will have 1 more turn before the end.
 ° The winning player will be whoever was able to move their markers past each other the furthest (in case multiple
players achieve this goal during the last turn.
)
 ° During a round, starting with the 1st player going clockwise, each player will place 1 worker into 1 of the many empty
action spaces and carry out the given action before the next player’s turn. When all players are out of workers, the
round ends.
General Rules to get Started:
 ° As stated above,
  --n a players turn, they will place one of their workers onto an empty action space and take the action.
 ° There are 4 different areas of the board (Quarry, Market, Harbor, Palace) where players can place workers (see below
for detailed descriptions of each action area)
 ° Some of the action spaces have a cost associated with them when you place your worker there.
  -- If the space in the center of the action space is empty, it’s free!
  -- If the space shows a coin value, pay it (move marker backwards.
)
  -- If the space shows a die, return the indicated die (color and pip value might matter.
)
   ---Pip-less die mean “any value,” and a Tan die mean “any color”
 ° Anytime in the game you earn Fame or money, you move your marker immediately (earning any bonuses on the track as
you go,) and when you earn dice (if any remain of that color,) roll the dice immediately and place on your Kali Statue.
  -- Your Kali Statue holds 10 dice. If you were to take an 11th, you can refuse it or replace 1 on the Statue already.
 ° Karma – Is a resource earned throughout the game that is tracked above the Palace on the upper left side of the board.
  -- It allows a player (at anytime on their turn) to flip 1 die to the opposite side by sliding your cube down 1 space.
  -- You can spend as many Karma points as you want on your turn. The max to hold at 1 time is 3 (see track.
)
 ° New Workers – As the game progresses, you will be moving your money, fame and boat markers along their respective
paths. If you reach the space with 1 of your workers, you take it and immediately add it to your pool, ready to work!
Once you receive your 5th worker, the 6th worker still on the board is removed to the box. Only 5 can be earned in total.
 ° Scoring Track Bonuses – Along the Fame and Money track, you will earn rewards when you reach certain numbers.
  -- Since you can only go forward on the Fame track, the rewards are simply printed on the board for when you
reach them, you earn them. They are spaces 5, 24 and 31.
  -- The Money track is different as there is a small token you will use. You see, since your money can go up and
down, the designers made it easy to remember if you got the bonus yet or not. The first time you cross this
bonus marker, take the reward, flip the token, and move it up to the next space that matches this bonus token.
The spaces that will have bonuses are 12, 33, 44, and 55. Take a look! After the bonus at 55, remove the token.
Quarry Action (Place Province Tiles on your Player Board)
 ° In the middle of the board are actions spaces (in 2 rows) with cost values from 1-4 (remember to pay). Next to them is
an icon of a tile being placed on a Province board. Well, activating 1 of these spaces will allow you to d  --just that!
 ° After placing your worker, and paying the cost, look at 1 of the 12 face-up Province tiles next to the board. You can
“buy” a face-up tile by returning any number of matching colored dice to the supply with a sum of at least the value
shown in the upper left corner. You can overpay for tiles this way.
 ° After paying for your tile with dice, take it and place it on your player board so that at least 1 road on the tile can be
traced back to your Estate (the building in the upper middle). Yes, you can rotate your tile any direction you wish and
you can cut off other roads, as long as 1 road on your newly placed tile can make its way back home!
 ° After you place your tile legally, you will earn rewards based on what is showing on the tile itself.
  -- If 1 of the 4 buildings is showing, immediately earn Fame points equal to that building’s currently Fame level.
  -- If it shows 1 of the 3 Markets, earn money equal to the printed money shown.
  -- Obviously, earn all rewards shown (you might have multiple buildings or multiple markets.
)
 ° Around the edge of your Province are special “Yield” rewards. After scoring the Province tile itself, if a road connects to
this Yield reward back to your Estate, you immediately get the bonus! If a Yield reward is blocked off, you can’t earn it.
 ° When you are done getting your rewards, flip the next tile over in the stack you chose from.
Market Action Spaces (Earn money based on Markets in your Province)
 ° Just under the Quarry spaces are the Market action spaces. The each top row action space deals with a specific type of
good, while the bottom spaces deal with all 3 different types of goods.
 ° If you place a worker on 1 of the top spaces, you will first give up a die with any numeric value on it (the higher the
better possibilities,) and then do the following:
  -- Each of these spaces is associated with 1 of the 3 goods found in the Markets of your Province (tea, silk, spices.
)
  -- If you place your working on the Tea space, you will select a number of different tea markets in your Province
(that can be traced back to your Estate via roads) up to the value on the die you turned in. (example, turn in a 3
die, you can count up to 3 different tea markets on your Province board. Turn in a 4, you can count 4… so on…)
  -- Calculate the total money shown on these different Markets and earn that amount of money immediately.
  -- The Silk and Spices space work exactly the same.
 ° If you place a worker on a bottom space (no player may access both bottom spaces in the same round (3/4 p game,) see
different color worker icons,) then you will look at your Province board and choose 3 different type markets (1 tea, 1 silk,
1 spices) that trace back to your Estate via roads and earn the shown money value immediately! This space has no cost!
River Action Spaces (Move your Boat on the River for Rewards)
 ° Under the Market spaces is the Harbor, and this area controls the movement of your Boat on the river.
 ° Whenever a player is to move their boat during the game, they always move it forward, they never count spaces other
players are on, and they immediately take the reward when the boat has stopped moving.
 ° The Harbor spaces all have a coin cost except the first space which is free!
 ° When putting your worker here, discard any die with a 1, 2 or 3 value (see chart to the right in the Harbor).
  -- If a 1 is discarded, the player moves their boat 1 unoccupied space up the river.
  -- If a 2 is discarded, the player moves their boat 1-2 unoccupied spaces up the river, player’s choice.
  -- If a 3 is discarded, the player moves their boat 1-3 unoccupied spaces up the river, player’s choice.
 ° The last space of the River can hold several boats, but once you reach this space, you can’t take boat actions anymore.
 ° See the Rulebook for the individual descriptions of each space.
Palace Action Spaces (Ways to Manipulate your Dice pool)
 ° The Palace takes up the bottom left part of the board. It includes 19 action spaces from the Chambers (people) all the
way to the Balcony space (shows “shaking” dice).
 ° These are what the spaces do in detail:
  -- The 6 Chamber People
   ---1 – Give up any value 1 die to get 2 fame points and take the 1st player marker for next round.
   ---2 – Give up any value 2 die to get any 2 dice in return and 1 white yield token sitting on the white
building. Gain the reward of the Yield token immediately and discard it. If the pile runs out, reshuffle it.
   ---3 – Give up any value 3 die to get 2 Karma and 1 die of your choice.
   ---4 – Give up any value 4 die to advance 1 of your buildings up 1 level and earn 3 money.
   ---5 – Give up any value 5 die to choose any Province tile, place it on top of any Province tile already built
with a lower die cost, and pay 1+ dice totaling the difference in value of the 2 tiles in the color of the
new tile. The new tile will not earn “Yield rewards” but it will earn rewards for what is on the tile itself.
Also, this new tile must obey the laws of tile placement. It must be traceable back to the Estate.
   ---6 – Give up any value 6 die to move your boat on the river exactly 6 unoccupied spaces. If you are
within the last 6 river spaces, you can’t use this action anymore. Must be able to move exactly 6 spaces.
  -- The Terrace/Balcony Spaces
   ---The single space on the very end lets you take 2 money and re-roll any number of your dice.
   ---The spaces that are touching a colored die reward you with 1 die of that color.
   ---The spaces that show a colored die in the action space require 1 die of this color as payment to receive 2
dice of the other color as the reward.
End of the Round:
 ° After everyone has placed all their workers (a player might have a skipped turn if other players have more workers) the
round will end.
 ° If a player took the 1st player marker by going to the #1 space in the Chambers, then that player is 1st player for the next
round. If no one went to that space, pass the Elephant clockwise.
 ° Everyone now takes back all their workers placed this round and starts a new round!
End Game:
 ° During the round, when 1 player has their Fame marker reach and/
  --r pass their money marker, the game is triggered.
 ° At this time, each player going clockwise until the last player is reached will get 1 more turn to place 1 more worker (if
the last player is the one to trigger the game then the game will end now.
)
 ° When the game ends, the player who moved their Fame and Money marker the furthest apart (ties broken by the player
who did this first) will win the game!
Navaratnas Version (Advanced Game):
 ° Instead of only being able to get 2 new workers like in the standard game, you can claim all 3 workers on the board.
 ° You will use the other side of the Kali Statue which allows you to only store 8 dice, instead of 10 in the standard game.
 ° You will use the other side of your Province Board as well. You will notice some empty Yield spaces around the edge.
  -- During Set-up, take the Brown Yield tiles, flip them face-down, and each player takes 1 randomly, looks at it, and
covers up 1 of the 2 Brown Yield spaces on their Province board. It doesn’t matter which Brown space is
covered. You won’t earn the reward now, but you will earn it in game when you connect to this Yield token.
   ---See the descriptions of the new bonus Yield tokens in the rulebook.
  -- You will now sort the 4 different colored Yield tokens by color and place them face-up on their matching
buildings on the right side of the board. (Same area you put the white tokens face-down in the standard game.
)
 ° There are 2 ways to obtain new Yield tokens during the game:
  -- When you select the #2 person in The Chambers.
   ---This person allows you to get any face-up Yield token from 1 of the buildings. Select 1 and add it to your
Province board, but it can only cover up a matching color. You won’t earn the reward yet, but you will
earn it when you connect to this Yield token via a road going back to your Estate.
  -- When you have fewer workers than others!
   ---If you are “skipped over” during a round because other players still have more workers, then you get to
take 1 Yield token of your choice and place it on your Province board covering a matching color space.
Again, the reward will be earned when you connect to this token with a road leading back to the Estate.
 ° You are not required to take Yield tokens when allowed, and you can’t place a Yield token on top of another Yield token.
The Ganga Module (Customize the River Spaces)
 ° During set-up, mix the 8 river tokens face down, then roll a die. Count out that many spaces and choose 1 of the token
to flip over and place on this space (creating a new space for the game).
 ° Repeat this process until you reach the end of the river. The final river space can’t be covered up.
 ° All 8 river tokens might not be placed out. See the rulebook for a detailed description of the new tokens.
 ° Obviously, you can turn the tiles face-up and customize the river spaces however you wish for a certain strategic game.
